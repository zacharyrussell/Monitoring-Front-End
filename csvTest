come up after our presentation next slide please were very proud to provide an update since the last time we were here just five months ago theres a significant amount of work significant amount of recommendations that were certainly appointed to by the auditors office we welcome these opportunities to be able to improve upon and extend upon our capabilities to serve the community and certainly prepare ourselves to be able to respond to disasters given the amount of information that we have today what wed like to do is proceed at a tempo giving the committee time to ask questions at the end and so with that on the next slide we will begin so each of the recommendations has this similar format this first one is to prepare for significant catastrophic events   93803 am  it really points to the ability to train and do exercises for our internal staff on an annual basis hsem conducts eoc trainings and other tabletop trainings in order to operate in the eoc the emergency operations center as well as to anticipate seasonal events such as were able to anticipate while disasters here locally as well as significant  special events like south by southwest id like to point to a couple of trainings weve been able to insert into the process given the interest and need to increase our capability thats the senior officials workshop this was conducted last month particularly with an emphasis for our city council and the rest of our leadership team in order to have a common understanding and goal and focus on how we might better be   93904 am  prepared to approach disasters the other one that is up there is a national radiological exercise this has been in the planning for a while we were fortunate to have it occur in the last month that really focused on a different kind of incident radiological incident on the next slide again usc training weve conducted six since the fall and again based on the interest of the departments not only to provide training for people that  employees that are sliding into new positions that might be in the eoc but also some departments have indicated an interest in refresher training for those in the eoc theres a number of training sessions that hsem has that has put forth for that purpose next slide like to hand it over now to director ortiz  thank you number 2 is the city manager   94007 am  prioritize planning this effort actually got started prior to the pandemic the pandemic required us to reallocate resources in support of the pandemic we have reengaged in this area can in the fall of 21 and working with all the different city department partners to move the needle in this regard we want to thank council for approving the spending authority this will allow us to better plan and schedule and work with the departments that need to be transitioned into the new system  chair excuse me me director not everyone knows what coop stands for i want to ensure that the general public knows what youre talking b  that is an excellent point i apologize coop like you said is continuity of  operations planning as we move with these operations plans development were working with the different city departments to ensure that theyre all done as fast as    94108 am  as best as we can given the information we have from the departments now that the spending was authorized now were working with the departments to look at their availability of funds and will work with them to schedule when is the best time for them to complete it depending on the availability of funding we think that this can be completed within the next two fiscal years next slide again this is a face approach were going to  working with the auditors office to revise the implementation date and as we move forward this approach for the plan development will be  we see it coming forward within the next fiscal years what i wanted to cover in this slide here is this is a two   94209 am  phased approach for coop planning as well as we have conducted several tabletop exercises and other activities in order to validate the information that is going into the system and that is something going  moving forward as well as we have additional work that was done in the it disaster recovery plans to ensure that the critical applications were included in that process next slide slide no 3 this is a city manager indiscernible implement initiatives to increase disaster preparedness and community resiliency we have several major efforts that are underway at this point in this area im going to ask sara henry to come up to the podium and give us an update specifically in the preparedness portion  thank you juan next slide please we were very fortunate city council approved over 250000   94311 am  in funding for this preparedness campaign to date weve put together what is called emergency preparedness make it your super power through this campaign we have managed traditional paid media outreach ads on streaming services and social media campaigns which are running in multiple languages weve also established relationships with heb and walmart retailers if youll go to the next slide over 280000 people have been reached today with just the social media can campaigns alone our next steps with this campaign are to further spend the funds with additional marketing and community engagement opportunities and with that ill turn it over to sustainability to talk about resiliency hubs  good morning councilmembers my name is  im the new chief resilience officer like my colleague just mentioned this effort has been part of the sustainability   94411 am  office for quite some time now were in the process of transition phase so im happy to bring in some updates into these efforts and the transition efforts and the transition process disasters of this magnitude truly do bring transformational change we must use this momentum to drive forward and  council has prioritized this through the resolution that has  the city manager to create a plan and recommendations to create resilience hubs but we have also learned through this process that its important to take a step back and leverage the resources that already exist in our communities this is where the city can help convene can help facilitate and really can help empower so the resilience hubs program is in its early stages of a   94512 am  pilot program but the goal is to build a fullscale network of facilities that provide services and programs to all austinites during emergencies and also during blue sky days next slide please so over the past few months there have been significant updates and significant milestones that have been accomplished six focus areas have been identified in the eastern crescent and this has been through engagement process with a community advisor and  and set of working groups this has been led by the office of sustainability and i do want to recognize my colleague mark from the office of sustainability project manager for this effort that is here with us today a community engagement consultant has also been procured and the work for community engagement in this specific area is expected to start at the end of june   94613 am  and expected to end at the end of the summer the goal of this community engagement process will finalize and will end in the selection of six specific locations sites in the community that will serve as a first six pilot resilience hubs in our community finally i will say that a brochure and efforts to expand on communication materials has been initiated the next steps is  as i mentioned we will finalize the community engagement process of these specific  well continue formulating the next phases to expand the program to other city areas and how to scale it up to not just the eastern crescent but all of austin as well as launch a communication campaign to tie into existing emergency communications as well as other services i do want to highlight that this   94714 am  has been an effort brought forward through sustainability in coordination with hsem as well as external agencies travis county and iasd we will continue to align with all of these agencies and community members and the internal departments there was an updated memo that was presented earlier this week and in this slide there is a link that provides a more detailed information on the updates indiscernible thank you ill hand it back to juan  next slide implement pass  indiscernible actions and recommendations related to disaster preparedness and response for this slide im going to ask linda  to come up to the podium as to how were moving   94815 am   forward with corrective action process  thank you juan okay id like to focus more so on the recommendations part for the afteraction recommendations with the winter storm yuri there were 132  next slide please there were 132 recommendations that were identified out of those 132 recommendations we came to you in january we had evaluated and we identified 32 of those that we could immediately begin work on and they had  which had a high impact but required little to know resources and little to no budget this slide is what we presented to you back in january as to what we were within the focus areas of communication planning and preparedness transportation logistics and one in the logistics and supply chain were in progress we had 12 which was 375 and we were awaiting updates on 15   94916 am  of those which is 469 next slide as of june weve completed ten more which was a total of 15 which makes up 47 within the focus areas of communication planning and preparedness and logistics within communications there were seven of them one example you heard about was the ready central texas campaign we extended the language access in that campaign in the  there were four in planning and preparedness one of the  an example im giving to you that we closed was solidifying the role of the equity office in our emergency operations center which was significant for us because in the four logistical and supply chains the example im going to use to you is how we utilized the equity office to help us in our distribution of services where we utilized  we were able to better utilize an equity   95016 am  lens with the distribution of services in our recent events in progress we still  we have eight which is 25 and awaiting updates we have 9 which is 28 next slide please also at the meeting we talked about our plans to create a system that houses all the recommendations in a central location that will be accessible to everyone for transparency while were excited to introduce to you today the new chris system it stands for community resiliency and improvement status portal this system was developed by city of austin and travis county and its a dynamic portal that features afteraction reports from significant events the system is very user friendly it allows you to track status of   95116 am  recommendations by taking a holistic view with a dashboard or drilling down into the event by the recommendation it also aligns with fema federal emergency management agency standards which is categorized by mission areas and theyre incorporated into the mission areas the system will be publicly available in july at dataaustin texasgov next slide please the data housed in crisp are tenney vents dating back to 2013 theyve all been loaded into the portal i will not read them all youll have them as backup they are in the system currently right now next slide this is a nap shot of what youre going to see when you go into the portal   95216 am   you will  the beginning part of it will be an introduction that tells you about crisp tells you what its about but then you see the dashboard this is a snapshot in time keep in mind its dynamic it refreshes every two hours so the data will be readily available and should be  were hoping that it will be as current  were trying to get it as current as possible at the top of the dashboard of the snapshot youll see where you can actually search by event you can search by mission area and the third one is going to be by core capability when you look at the top to my right the record count there are 1147 recommendations that are in the system right now when you look at the pie they are designated by the recommendation by mission area which is based off of fema standards and the second pie is based off status   95317 am  you can see where it tells you it is completed and progress closed and not started when you drill further down into the system youll see at the bottom youll see where you can actually click on the recommendation and the recommendation will  you can get a further  you can get further details on the status of each recommendation built into the system we hope this allows for information to be available to you at all times and we also hope this is a way of being transparent in regards to all of our recommendations i will now turn it back over to acm ray arellano  so this is  this recommendation has to do with resource staffing within homeland security emergency management i think over the last two years weve clearly seen what with the pandemic responding to the normal course of emergencies in 2020 and 21 as well as winter   95418 am  storm yuri we had a sense there was more resourcing needed and the auditors report clearly pointed out areas we needed to focus weve completed an evaluation with them and come forward in the shortterm with reallocating longstanding vacancies in order to start the process of beefing up its capability you see here two of them are going to be focused on resiliency hub activities this is meant to unload if you will or shift the load from the sustainability office which again i want to recognize have done such a great job of laying the foundation for our chief resiliency officer to carry the ball forward two of the positions are going to be focused on doing the work thats required again particularly around mass casualty coordination which will be very helpful at again extending the capability outreach into the community and helping the community be   95518 am  prepared as well as staff to be prepared to respond so the focus for hsem going forward is to fill the vacancies reclassify the four positions so they can begin filling them and then i would say the positions that weve identified that are necessary to beef up hsems capability they will be  in the fiscal year 2023 budget next slide please go back one there you go update policy and process for had ensuring adequate staff are trained and available to respond to disasters weve done major work in this area  the main thing is p here as we  we are conducting monthly coordinated meetings with different city departments with their single points of contact   95619 am  in order to ensure were coordinating with the departments looking at what the upcoming training and exercise schedules look like make sure the departments are up to date with what information they need to be coordinating within their departments to ensure that their personnel is trained and ready for the upcoming disaster season so this is a monthly meeting that were holding in fact theres a meeting taking place right now as we speak to ensure that were closing the gap between the level of readiness and preparedness between the different city departments as well in addition to that were also exploring other ways of identifying the staffing resources specifically were looking at what contractors could be placed on stand by or under contract to assist in the city in responding to future disasters as well as using temporary agencies to fill specific position gaps in the   95721 am  future we have brought on board a temporary personnel resource manager this is temporary position that is working with human resources department to identify available staff in the event of an emergency or disaster and their role is to work with hrd to ensure that we are finding what resources may be available for different departments to better assist in the event of an emergency or disaster lastly i want to kind of  you might have heard me mention this before but we are utilizing recently retired city employees that have been willing to come out of retirement and assist the community in the event of an emergency or disaster where we call them the disaster reservists and these are in lots of different areas and to include purchasing and accounting as well as other areas from fire police and ems   95824 am  and facilities and fleet and other different  anybody thats a recently city retired employee that is willing to be a part of the disaster reservists were in the process of formalizing that process of recruiting and better strengthening this program as we move forward we think that this is a way of leveraging expertise that employees have acquired in their careers for the city and give them an opportunity to help the community in the future if there is an emergency or disaster that requires that to happen next slide number 7 is ensure the city has adequate emergency supplies and equipment for future disasters we have secured a specific quantities of water and meals ready to eat from a company called heater meals other key resources and supplies   95926 am  where we are storing them and the quantities that were able to keep is really depending on the available warehouse space that we have but we have secured those resources and theyre intended to  be a bridge to allow us to then in the event of an emergency have something in place that will allow us to get additional resources from outside of the area also wanted to let you know that were working on a disaster food and drinking water appendix to the mass care plan this is intended to ensure that we are better aligned and have a better system in place to identify food shortages as well as be able to have a closer connection with communitybased organizations as we respond to the need for food and water in an emergency   100027 am  also additional work is going to be required to look at the development of logistics supply chain management strategy the hope is that if we develop this supply chain management strategy it will make us more resilient and less  to the national worldwide shortage impacts that are facing the  facing communities at this time everything from fuel shortages as well as baby formula shortages we need to be less dependent on just in time so we need to be really looking at a  developing a strategy that makes us more resilient in this regard some of the challenges that were going to need to overcome we need to identify adequate warehouse space as well as stationary and the necessary staff to handle these situations in the future next slide   100130 am  number 8 is create an implement a language access plan for emergencies to ensure effective communities receive adequate information in this slide im going to ask sara to come back to the podium and give us an update on the progress were making in this regard  thank you again so one of the challenges that we heard of and live through during storm yuri was that staff who were responding to the storm also didnt have power or water so one of the things that  cpio to establish is increase or vendor capacities for out of state vendors for translation services as well as we have established a contract with links for asl interpretation both of these benefits weve seen through the heat advisory and heat warning ings dents last week ill also share for the february storm of 22 as well as for the boil water notice city staff spent over 17000 on translation services for just   100230 am  those two incidents so continued resources will be needed as these emergencies arise thank you  thank you sara next slide this is an example of the language access that has been already translated you can see ten languages so this is the part of our language access plan next slide number 9 ensure the citys disaster response efforts are equitable and meet the needs of vulnerable populations in the community im happy to report that were making great strides in this area not only has the equity office role been identified in the emergency operations centers operating guidelines as well as weve also made modifications to   100332 am   our plan development sops and our planned development procedures which will now incorporate language to assure that equity is a part of the plan development or update process it ensures that we will have their participation and their contributions in the development of documents as we move forward in addition to that we modified plan development process the equity office has been very instrumental in our recent responses and this is an area where were going to be showing you by actually practicing so as we have  in the recent emergencies or disasters that were facing we have utilized the equity office very successfully and they were instrumental in helping us identify the appropriate points   100435 am  of distribution in the most recent crisises that we had as well as come up with a solution for the delivery of water at residential homes that was in cooperation with capital metro and the disaster relief network and equity office working together to come up with a solution how to meet the needs of the community so those are examples of how were going to not only say that were going to do something but were going to put it into action and demonstrate and youll be able to see that as we move forward another perfect example is the equity office working closely with hsem as we were identifying the supplies that we were going to be incorporating in our shelter missionready prepackage they were able to look at our list and ensure the cultural inclusion and equities of supplies were part of the   100535 am  process and that influence determined the supplies that were ultimately put in the containers as we were getting ready for the last winter weather season next slide number 10 development of a plan to involve community in disaster preparedness and planning as was reported in the recommendation number 5 a position that was reallocated by the city manager what is to fill the role of the mass care coordinator this position is going to be instrumental in helping coordinate with community partners communitybased organizations and first responders and look at how best to align those response efforts in making sure that we are moving forward as a community were not just doing this for winter weather it is a yearround approach that   100640 am  were taking into consideration as we move forward in addition other perfect examples of how were meeting the recommendation is the recent effort that was undertaken by resiliency officer working with community resiliency trust as were looking to address the baby food formula shortage in that coordination effort that was conducted by resiliency officer as well as the work being done with the neighborhood resiliency hub outreach and campaign and then also the development of preparedness guides and disaster flyers in conjunction with other departments that work was participated by the watershed protection department and homeland security and emergency management department  those are perfect examples of how were trying to meet the intent of this recommendation well have more to report in the future updates next slide   100745 am   thank you juan again committee members theres a lot of work that has been done im very proud and the team is very proud about the work thats been accomplished yet we understand that theres more work to be done as well particularly in the areas of bringing the resiliency hub concept to fruition and certainly addressing all of the recommendations that are now available on the crisp portal these efforts are not accomplished in silos but an interdepartmental coordination and collaboration as well as with external stakeholders in order to make all of this work you know we are really intent on driving transformational change that can really change the way that we do business more effectively as well as efficiently really like to leave you with the thought that we are better prepared to respond to the normal course of course its difficult to see what is normal these days but the normal course of disasters that we might experience and are well on our way to being able to respond to low probability high impact   100847 am  incidents like winter storm yuri represents and with that again on behalf of the team were pleased to be here and respond to any questions that you may have thank you  chair thank you i also hope were prepared for high probability high risk events like wildfire as well as you know so thank you all for the presentation and your work as is often the case in this committee were going to spend a lot more time asking questions about the next steps but before we do that just want to thank our staff who have been operating under emergency for quite some time under difficult conditions and we very much appreciate all the work that you do and i think part of what i imagine some of our questions are going to be about today and ill let my colleagues go first on the questions is going to be about making sure that you have the resources and support that you need to do your job   100948 am  effectively and look forward to our conversation councilmember kelly  kelly thank you id like to start off by saying that i understand this presentation today took a lot of work by the agency and staff im thank full that they carried that list for the community to make the city of austin better equipped in regards to emergency management director ortiz i was able to attend one of your sessions of the texas emergency management conference in san antonio recently i wanted to publicly comment on your knowledge and ability to pack a room from all across the state i appreciated the presentation and the feedback from people who i spoke with afterwards was absolutely glowing its my hope that the city of austin has a world class homeland security and emergency management program were a big city and we need to ensure that we are successful in the disaster planning process ahead of time so we come out of the other side stronger as a community than we were before i do want to say however its important for council to fully understand that in order for you to be able to effectively plan    101050 am  for and respond to disasters that your office does need these staff outside of the staff that you mentioned in the presentation i was wondering if there were unmet needs that youd like to share with council that we can help advocate for during the budget process  thank you councilmember for those kind words the presentation was in partnership wa travis county and working very closely with travis county as we move forward additional resource requests that we submitted to the fy 23 budget process and those are going through that process and i would say that youll see them as  were waiting to see what your decision will be once those represented when the city manager presents his budget  kelly okay thank you could you maybe help us understand how the community engagement process will look in   101150 am  regards to the selection of the six resiliency hubs  let me see if i can get somebody  so let me  ill take an attempt to answer the question i think that the community engagement as it relates to resiliency hubs its going to be close in hand with the overall message of preparedness and its important that as we engage with a different neighborhoods and looking at how to build that level of resiliency level of tenacity in the community that were  that were not reinventing the wheel but really more  from the full preparedness that we are laying out and looking at what the neighborhoods are  what the assessment of the neighborhood has identified as gaps in their ability to be more resilient anything else no   101250 am   ill just add that this is a process councilmember that we are beginning through our consultant that was just procured and the steps are being outlined as we continue to develop that specific scope of work what is really important in this process is to ensure that the specific areas that have been identified in the six areas the communities being brought in is not just through the typical outreach that has been employed but is more meaningful and authentic and so it includes languages that are tailored specifically to the community it involves specific materials workshops as well that are designed in a way that the community can help not just pick the locations but identify the   101351 am  specific services that these locations are going to provide and ultimately help design what this facility ultimately will provide for them exactly  kelly im sorry we didnt hear what you said director ortiz  we need to be able to empower them to be more resill yet  kelly thank you for that thats my last and final comment real quick i wanted to take a moment and remind the community that resiliency starts with personal preparedness that includes making a plan building an emergency kit three small  steps that everybody can take to make sure their family has a best outcome when disaster strikes councilmember tovo real quick i wanted to briefly highlight item 51 on our agenda this week that youre sponsoring id like to cosponsor that i will say that tomorrow i believe i have an amendment or two in consideration to personal preparedness that id like to bring forward ill post that to the message   101453 am  board for you thank you very much everyone  thank you  thanks very much this is really super helpful around im really pleased to hear all of the work a couple of things that i took note of the database to track the recommendations and the progress that very helpful really excited to hear about the disaster reservist i have a few questions in that area planning with for a stock of water and food and other kinds of things which i would assume have been part of the practice in the past but it sounds like theres more transparency and intentionality around it having translators outside of texas and i thought we saw last week with the cooling center with the promotion of cooling centers a real important step of utilizing the resources and leveraging the resources we already have but also importantly getting that word out in a very intentional public way so   101554 am  thank you i think thats all really good progress with regard to the disaster reservists i heard director ortiz you said those were retired individuals are they also current city staff and departments that would not necessarily be pulled in to working with  responding to a disaster   so that would be a little bit different existing city staff thats that role of that personnel resource manager temporary position that i talked about were working  were utilizing that position working with hrd to identify a way of how do we identify those  the available pull of city  pool of city employees that can be reassigned or voluntarily be reassigned to support disasters and how do we work through that process of having the right incentive or compensation for that work that is being done in support of a   101655 am  disaster then maybe after hours or it may be in lieu of work so were working through that process right now but its separate from the disaster reservists because what we learned from the  from the pandemic is that the longer the disaster is the departments need to get back to some type of normal operations  sure no i understand that i like the idea of calling them all disaster reservists for clarity but that is not my decision as i understand it the disaster reservists are retired folks who might be pulled back in then you have a plan for city staff  youre doing training of city staff from other departments who would serve in the eoc and then theres a third effort going on to identify  to identify the staff or just identify  identify how they would be compensated are you planning on identifying and training those staff who are kind of our city disaster reservists out in the departments who would be pulled in who   101756 am   would opt into that  correct excuse me the identification of those staff what role theyre going to play in a disaster and make sure theyre trained and prepared as we move forward so traditionally what we do is we focus mostly on shelters but as the recent events in the last couple of years we realize that we have other expertise that may be necessary that deal with resource management points of distribution and other activities that we need to be more flexible more nimble in order to meet the disaster needs in the future unfortunately climate change is telling us that we need to get ready  i would say work perform in different areas how many vacancy doss we currently have  in houston right now we are working through two vacancies three vacancies   101857 am  one was just recently promoted so theres resulted in a new vacancy going through the hiring process of that and another one was a reclassification that just got approved and we have interviews scheduled for this friday and then the third one now that we hired the new public information and marketing manager sarah now has a vacancy she will be starting the hiring process for that vacancy and some of these were vacancies as a result of workforce moving on to other bigger and better opportunities unfortunately we have to fill those gaps as best as we can  yeah i was noting that on slide 19 that your priority was to fill vacancies i was trying to get a sense of what they are sounds like there are about three  in addition to the four that we are in the process of reclassifying the two for the resiliency hub and the two for the other needs   101959 am  so if you take  so total we have seven four that were  that city manager reallocated to us   from where do you know from where  from management services i dont know specifically what positions they were but it was within the management services area so those are having to go through a reclassification process and were about halfway through that  and i did have  and i think thats my last area of questions for the moment so you have three vacancies plus four if its approved in the budget for  for four positions coming through another department which requires council approval the question i had for you im excited about the work that is going on and resilience im excited about it i think the pilot program is terrific and the identification of those six sites is important councilmember kelly mentioned my followup resolution to that which is   102059 am  on this weeks agenda to develop resilience toolkit i see a huge urgency behind that im so glad that we now have our chief resilience officer on board the toolkit is going to be critical because as mayor pro tem you just mentioned the threat of wild fires as we saw during the emergency we did have shelters in certain areas of town and not at all in others and we know disasters hit everywhere so we really cant afford not to have communities prepared in other areas and those places preidentified and those community groups preidentified who know how to assist in that kind of time frame we simply just  cant have another situation like last time where you know you had impromptu efforts from council and community members and others to stand up  to stand up shelters at a time where lots of folks around the city needed refuge so hopefully that followup resolution will be helpful in that area i did have a question about i understand the structure   102200 am  for the chief resilience officer position im trying to understand and maybe the budget is the time to talk about it but let me just air that im interested to know why the choice is to remove resilience from the work of the office of sustainability and reclassify those positions within indiscernible because as they are preparing for emergency i love the term that you used from our chief resilience officer theyre also doing important work during blue sky days and so to me that is the work of the sustainability office is really critically involved in creating you know community sustainability during and ongoing basis so i really see that resilience work very much centered within resilience and i guess maybe this is a question for jason alexander why the decision to move the on the grounds resilience hub work to husum rather than leave it within the office of   102300 am  sustainability  yes maam thank you jason alexander the chief of staff right now the resilience office is not positioned in a way to have additional staffing so in interest of time we decided that the resources were best fit in indiscernible that program work is already happening lauras role is essentially a collaborative role with hesam it made sense in the interest of time  i love actually that that position lives outside of those individual structure because i think it makes sense to pull and be collaborative with the different departments i guess i really do need to understand especially if those positions already are within the office of sustainability again i think  i think the ongoing daytoday work seems to be much more closely aligned with the office of sustainabilitys mission as i envisioned it as one of the folks who i think voted on the creation of that office no i guess i didnt i was innovation   102400 am  but in any case weve all helped fund and staff it through the years i just see their role as very critical to the mission of what we envision for the office of sustainability  if i may let me try to clarify were not taking from the office of sustainability rather the positions that we are now supplements in hesam are to conduct the work that other exists resources and sustainability were performing  right  so we are basically creating a pathway for those employees to go back to those projects as we mentioned yesterday work session they had climate priorities to deal with they can seize other locations throughout the management services department so we are not  to clarify again we are not taking resources from sustainability   im sorry i misspoke about it i understood what director droshortiz was saying i think im still  im still wondering about the choice of putting them in   102500 am   hesam rather than the office of sustainability because the daytoday work of those seem to be so connected to the work of the sustainability office so thats the question we can also chat more about it offline if that makes more sense  happy to  i think part of the reasoning behind it and this is a lot of it is because of the urgency of tackling really what the services what the communities are which is what the communities need in emergencies immediately and right now that is the work that hesam is  the primary role is and the work that director ortiz is leading that is really the primary phase that is being targeted right now in the pilot n setting up the pilot the pilot program the six area its initiating with what these sites conserve to immediately serve as the emergency hubs and building on to what they do in blue   102602 am  sky days right this is part of ultimately what the outreach program that were kicking off in the outreach campaign is kicking off in the next few weeks is going to help identify but primarily the immediate need and the urgency is for the emergency component of it in the long  in the long run and as we look at phase ii and phase iii of the program its standing up those programmatic needs and services that also look at economic resilience at community resilience as a whole and those are the elements that are going to be further explored in phase ii and phase iii as we expand and scale up the program not just within the individual sites and those pilot location but also citywide  thank you for that explanation i think  and i guess i am trying to think about the longterm and thats why phase ii and 3 seem really again to be just part of the office of sustainabilitys mission so  anyway we can talk more about it but   102702 am  thank you very much  thank you councilmember tovo ill point out i think it was a resolution that councilmember pool put forward i am pretty sure i was a cosponsor and you were a cosponsor that created the office of resilience chief resilience officer if not mistaken  i think i was talking about the sustainability which i was thinking our council had voted on but it was before all of our time  okay councilmember pool did you have any questions okay great i will ask a couple several of mine have already been answered i wanted to find out a little bit about the mass care position and what that role will be can you tell us a little more  yes the mass care coordinator position what we have identified in recent disasters is that we need to do a better job of closing the gap between the different community based organizations that are out there in our community   102803 am  willing to help out in a disaster and make sure that were coordinating those efforts with our city and county efforts as well so a mass care coordinator will be tasked with building creating a community organizations active in disaster and having a  a process about all the different community organizations can be engaged in future disaster responses they are going to be engaging with the  different community based organizations on a consistent basis make sure that we are collaborating in areas where we see collaboration to better prepare as well as a response there will also be supervising some of our shelter efforts and our food and water access efforts and for right now also will be overseeing part of the work that were doing in the  in those resiliency or resiliency hubs arena   102905 am   i would ask that this person also be sure that they are connecting across the city and not just in the eastern crescent where were doing our pilots for the resilience hubs i understand that the pilot phase should be focused on the eastern crescent but we dont know how these disasters are going to play out and if we have no resources on the west side and theres a disaster on the east side and it cant be supported we will be in trouble and vice versa and so there is a risk in putting all of our resilience efforts in one area of town for the resilience of the whole city obviously we have to start somewhere and thats where the most immediate need is and so that is an appropriate step but you know we do need to make sure that the synagogues and the churches and the temples you know for instance are engaged the schools you know on the west side because we   103006 am  dont have a lot of the other resources in terms of the hubs there arent the neighborhood centers there arent those resources so the mass care coordinator is really going to need to complement what the resilience hubs are doing as we move forward so i want to make sure that is part of how theyre thinking about it obviously it needs to be everywhere but i want to make sure that we are providing for resilience across the community the other thing that i wanted to dive into is the warehousing constraints im hearing more and more that this is a challenge with our emergency preparedness had several conversations with austin disaster relief network and gotten into some specifics of their needs my question is whether you are tuned in to the work that our real estate office is doing about our warehouse needs and their current project for that   103107 am   yes we are working real closely with darrell alexander in those efforts warehousing is a  is something that is going to be very critical in our ability to maintain a local stockpile of resources to be able to support future disasters at a state level i think this is something that even the state of texas has realized and they have deployed six strategic regional state warehouses in order to be able to support statewide disasters we have recognized that especially in the beginning of the  of the hurricane harvey the 2018 boil water crisis the winter storm uri the pandemic all have  all those corrective   103207 am   actions have resulted in we need to identify a  a suitable climate control warehouse in order to be able to maintain adequate emergency supplies on hand to support emergencies and be less dependent on just in time which as you can see has impacted greatly in a  in a supply chain crisis  thank you im not sure that it was darrell alexander who was  it was andy in real estate that i think we were  weve been talking with and i say this because this is part of our efforts to move for leased properties to owned properties and theyre doing that visioning right now for our warehouses and i think its really important that hesam be involved in those conversations both for hesam but also for these key nonprofits that work with us you know when i talk with adrn they have  its   103307 am  not a huge amount of warehouse its like 10000 square feet they need in the scheme of things doesnt seem that big but you know can we build that into  if were going to do essential warehousing areas you know are there ways to build you know to build that and for that access for nonprofits as well with access to some of these supplies that we may or may not have or were relying on them to hold those  yeah in the office of real estate we work with michael gates and hes helped us identify different locations that may be available for lease or purchase but thats the question is securing the funding for either lease or purchase to address those needs  okay there is also a whole  like a strategic process for our warehouses that i want to make sure that you are looped into  yes  okay   103407 am  im pleased to see the system set up i think that comes out of the conversations weve had in this committee i think thats really important i do want to point out though that you know you picked the 32  if i understood what was said correctly you picked the 32 elements of the after action that were the low hanging fruit and then you told us what they reported and theres a hundred other ones there that are not reported here and so while i appreciate the progress on the low hanging fruit that doesnt require budget i dont think that any of us gave direction not to seek to make the changes that are needed that require budgets that have come out of these reports so i would like some more information on the other hundred items i understand you have to categorize them et cetera and youve made more progress there but its  the sum total that we need to hear of  yes and we are working on the recommendations from   103508 am  urie and we can give you a report on the progress of all of those the reason we identified 32 is because thats what we identified at the last meeting out of those the priority  the priority of those these 32 that had the most benefit and could be implemented within a reasonable amount of time and but we can definitely  we dont need to say that we are not working on the other ones we are working on those as well and if we can provide you a report on that as well  thank you as appropriate and within your time frame obviously you need to get your hiring done and i dont want that reporting to get in the way we understand you have to make choices but i just want to communicate that is not  enough to do the low hanging fruit we need to be putting that forward and we have to understand what the tradeoffs are that were making when were not investing in those things and its hard if youre not presenting to us what those things are to understand what those tradeoffs are that are being made behind   103611 am  the scenes because we may not agree with the tradeoff once we have that information the last thing is  i know you spoke a little bit about kind of the budget and you said you were going through the budget process i would like to ask and if we have to well put it in as a budget question but youre going to come out with some stuff in the budget and theres going to be stuff you wanted that youre not going to have gotten and as a councilmember i need to know what you asked for that you did not get you know and what were not funding you know through that process i dont want to just know only what you were given i want to know what the needs are and what are the tradeoffs that were making through that now that may not be in the actual budget but i think you know were going to have to really be understanding that better and at this point thats a real black box as the budget process has evolved   103711 am   let him finish and then you can answer  ill say well be able to address those questions when they come  okay thank you and to my staff if you can plan on putting those questions indiscernible  yeah i was going to say that once upon a time that used to accompany the budget and it was called i think the horizons report and it was extraordinarily useful because it showed what each of the departments would do if they had more funding and you know i think sometimes the council did make decisions that were a little different than the ones that the manager brought forward but having that information in one place for each department i think is extraordinarily useful ive mentioned it each budget cycle and it hasnt come back yet so now we have to ask lots and lots of questions through the qa to get the information i think it was called the horizons document  that would be great if we could have something like that okay there are more questions we can ask but i think we need to move on in our  in our   103814 am  agenda thank you for being here we appreciate the work that youre doing and i think you know i just want to underscore again the need to make sure that you have the staff and the resources and the support across departments to do the work that we are asking of you either as  council is asking you or just you know how the disasters are  disasters are playing out appreciated the training that you did with us i think that was useful i think theres still some work to be done in that area in terms of preparedness but it was a good next step so thank you for organizing that training  thank you  thank you next up we have item 3 the city auditors integrity unit report this summarizes activities of the unit related to its fraud waste and abuse hotline    103924 am   thank you councilmembers my name is brian malloy the chief investigations at the office of the city auditor i run the integrity unit which is made of  staffed by four investigators and today im going to talk about our first 8 months of fiscal year 22 so could you advance so over the course of this presentation im going to go over some allegation trends that weve seen so far this year im going to talk about the investigations weve completed what investigations are on going additional outputs and achievements from the foreign investigators that make up the integrity unit next slide head line number here is so far through 8 months weve had 185 new allegations come into my team that puts us pace to have 278 allegations for the year it puts it at the number of allegations were seeing prepandemic before so many staff members started working from home i do believe the bulk of this increase is part of the citys return to work   104024 am  programs employees are coming back into the office that gives them more opportunity to see concerning behavior other red flag they then report to my team now that pace for 278 is average of the first 8 months weve seen an up tick in the most recent three months if those three months are more indicative of what we see the rest of the year we could see close to 300 allegations come in next slide as far as the allegations that come into the office we kind of split them we do an initial triage into two cat dpoirks ones within our jurisdiction ones that are outside our jurisdiction on this slide the bulk of the one outside of the jurisdiction end up being age related issues harassment discrimination retaliation as well as other hr issues those end up getting referred to the hr teams in individual departments or the human resources department the next most common category is operational issue that was about 15 of the allegations that came in so far this year those also refer to the individuals   104125 am  departments the most common allegations weve seen come in over the first 8 months have been conflicts of interest with 18 theft theft of time inventory or cash there were 11 of those and then weve had seven abuse allegations 7 misuse allegations and four waste allegations next slide moving on to how we hear about these allegations this number right here aligns perfectly with industry best practices which state that if you want to hear about fraud waste and abuse or other problems going on in your entity you have to give informants a chance to report anonymously and the vast number choose to report anonymously we usually see about twothirds of our informants choosing to remain anonymous that ensures that were giving the best chance for us to hear about the various concerns in the city to let people report anonymously to be sure youre hearing about these things you have to make it easier to report the favored method weve seen this has been the case for the last couple of year   104226 am   most of our informants like to use the online reporting form a simple online tool it prompts the informant with various questions to make sure were getting relevant information and they can use it anonymously over twothirds like to use that 10 of our informants like to use the hotline which is a telephone number you can call a voice mail again you can do that anonymously lastly while not as big a as those first two six directly contacted an investigator on my team i like to point that out because it does show that the investigators on my team have earned some trust with people theyve dealt with over the course of careers completing investigation talking to witnesses and various other contact points in the city people have learned to trust them and reach out to them directly to share their concerns next slide allegations by department these are the top five areas  or top five departments in the city represented by allegations so far this year ill give trends when i do the full year analysis in   104328 am  the fall to show like which departments are ticking up versus ticking down so far this year austin energy has had the most allegations with 16 per capita that makes sense it is one of the largest departments in the city next up with city officials with 9 that area isnt just elected officials that includes all the citys boards and commission so appointed officials as well austin water is next with 8 and then animal services and austin public health each had 6 of the allegations that came in so far this year next slide all right moving on to investigations and before i get into these seven weve completed so far a bit of background any concern that gets brought to my office gets logged in our case management system as an allegation then well do that initial triage in our jurisdiction or out if its in our jurisdiction investigator will get assign and they will start investigating to see if they can substantiate or unsubstanceate what is alleged if that investigator obtains enough evidence individual   104428 am  to indicate its possible violation of this city code did occur well upgrade it in our system to an investigation the same investigator stays on it will continue their investigative path but when its an investigation they spend more time they know its a priority so it gets a bit more time energy and our focus once its at this investigation stage so far this year weve completed 7 investigations five were unsubstantiated we have either those two outcomes we document our findings and we share them with the relevant party to close out the investigation next slide focusing on the five that were substantiated that led to public report i have them listed out here the key take away is the accountability action that last column there for the first three the report led to employee separation that goes to show that departments agreed with our findings and were taking them seriously and took that accountability action you know the most severe they can take when dealing   104529 am   with an employee issue the final two those investigations were actually just published at the very end of may so their accountability action process is still going through department hr consultation with the human resources department so well find out what the ultimate decision is theyre so recent we dont know at the time of the presentation next slide so on going investigations where you hope to finish for the rest of fiscal year 22 we have open investigations across 6 departments and the issues they focus on include theft both inventory and time fraud conflict of interest misuse of city resources investigations take time we wont be able to complete all of those in this fiscal year but i do anticipate about a handful of these finishing by the time i report to you all in the fall next slide all right moving on from allegations investigations on to which additional achievements team of investigators have actually decided to focus on   104630 am  trainings and how we can improve both the city or our investigations community beyond just completing our own investigation so far this year weve presented trainings in front of four different professional association two national and two international weve conducted two internal trainings for the office of the city auditor and then a handful of times we presented to the city supervisor academy which is a series of different topics one of those is on city ethics its led by the law department but my team always comes in and presents for about 30 minutes to let supervisors know about our job function and then what we expect from supervisors if were going to have an investigation involving someone on their team we also assist with all risk and fraud assessments of audits that are conducted by the rest of the staff in our office and that our team actually holds six professional certifications and we have two more in progress so among those four investigators next slide so that includes my presentation im happy to take any questions ive also thrown   104731 am  up various ways people watching today can connect with our office if they have any concerns  thank you i think that last one is important for anyone who is watching obviously this is an important mechanism that we have in our  in our city to allow our employees or anyone else who comes across any instances of potential fraud or abuse to report that so that we can address them thank you for your report colleagues do you have any questions no can we check if councilmember pool does maybe take the slide down councilmember pool do you have any comments or questions  pool i dont have any questions i do appreciate the careful work that our auditors investigation unit continues to do and i also appreciate that it does inspire the confidence in the community for them to make their concerns known   104831 am  so thanks so much  thank you  thank you very much for your work all right next up we have the historic preservation fund update including the heritage preservation grant guidelines someone from economic development here good morning  good morning mayor pro tem susanna carvajal from  the economic development department with me today is melissa alvarado the division manager over the tourism division

manager of the heritage tourism division within the economic development department today ill be giving an update on the heritage preservation grant review process the draft guidelines and next steps we are putting forward a   105033 am  model of funding that will serve to expand program access and opportunity while more effectively promoting tourism to austin sorry in addition to best practice research and community conversations revisions to the guidelines date back to 2017 when an interagency visitor impact task force developed overarching recommendations that included equitable considerations to all users of the hotel occupancy tax funding to reflect a diversity of this community and in 2018 a heritage grant working group was formed to evaluate the historic preservation fund and grant uses that group supported expanding project eligibility and recognized the essential roll it would   105134 am  serve to help at track tourists and communicate historical and cultural significance to visitors in addition the group was in support of project in underrepresented geographic area and underrepresented communities or cultural groups the group also recommended increased outreach additional applicant support and reimbursement payments to encourage the participation of underrepresented communities nationally while all americans deserve to see their history in places that surround us just a small fraction of the sites on the national register of historic places represent diverse cultures the national task for historic preservation has led the movement to save historic places for the last 70 years now recognizes that as a nation we have work to do to fill in the gaps of our cultural heritage the historic preservation movement is pivoting to a   105237 am  peoplecentered preservation model that honors the full diversity of the everinvolving american story and it also in 2018 a city strategic direction 2023 plan was launched reinforcing that the city must lead with the lens of racial equity and healing in addition as a partner to the historic preservation office and  the historic landmark commission the heritage tourism division within the economic development department looks forward to further expanding program guidelines that represent community recommendations with the update to the historic preservation plan which is expected to be completed in 2023 so what is the goal to be achieved through revised guidelines the desired goal is to sustain and grow austins cultural infrastructure so that all may share in the   105338 am  economic and employment benefits of the heritage preservation and creative sectors as well as upholding the citys commitment to racial equity per the city of austins equity office standards and goals this hot funding review goal is directly in line with edds mission to promote a competitive sustainable and equitable economy for all since our last presentation to the audit and finance committee which is represented in phases 1 and 2 the heritage tourism division has done a number of assessments and improvements on program entry barriers access to equity training process audits tourism marketing training and expanded eligible expenses weve also recently relaunched an update to the heritage preservation grant guidelines based on previous community   105439 am  feedback received late

commission briefings and further staff assessment of feedback on the proposed guidelines we anticipate launching the heritage preservation grant program on september 8 edd staff plans to stagger launches of our programs to provide as much clarity access and assistance as possible to our potential applicants and with that i am happy to   110246 am  take any questions  alter thank you if we can take the share screen down and just so youre aware ctm councilmember kelly is going to be trying to sign on remotely for the rest of the meeting councilmember tovo did you have questions  tovo a few thank you i need to review the draft guidelines some of my questions may be answered within those but the last couple of slides where you discussed site criteria you dont need to pull it back up again but are you talking about the site for the historic preservation awards for the grants program to outside agencies or are you talking about those criteria in terms of city sites as well  for capital educational  all city sites all applicants must have a historic designation   110347 am  for capital planning and educationalrelated projects its only the capital projects that will require additional reviews of the historic landmark commission  tovo umm   i dont know if i answered your question  tovo im sorry let me rephrase it maybe i wasnt that clear you had a slide up that talked about sites criteria for sites i cant  unfortunately i cant tell you when it is because i dont have a copy of it it hasnt been put in the backup i dont believe yet well let me move on to my next question while we can figure out what slide that was are  will the council have the opportunity to approve the draft guidelines  umm so in the past the guidelines have not come before council the process has been that any    110449 am  recommendations have gone to the historic landmark commission and then its up to the commission to make any recommendations in terms of updates or additional changes to those recommendation to council as part of the approval of the overall fund an rca complete with all uses of the  of the fund and our recommendations relate to the heritage grant is packaged together in one rca for council approval  but thats after youve already  i mean at that point you will be proposing awards based on the criteria and the guidelines that we may not have had an opportunity to review or provide input 0 on or we may have provided input but its not incorporate corporated you know in so many of our programs we actually get to see and make changes and approve the guidelines i didnt realize that this was one where we would not have that opportunity   110550 am   im happy to share those guidelines following this meeting  tovo yeah i think more  well let me take a look at them and then we can kind of go from there but there are a few things that captured my attention one is  thank you for your work i think this is  its great to see this program fill out and i continue to just be so excited about the way were investing our hotel occupancy dollars in this  in this way we had a really great event at downs fields last week on friday and its yet another reminder of how important it is that we invest those dollars in places that promote tourism but also provide such a wonderful opportunity for austinites to come and spend time in them as well so that was a great investment i do have some concerns about what i understand to be part of the shifting criteria for the marketing piece i think i heard you say on that slide that there would   110651 am  be for profit  for profit businesses would be able to apply for that i have to give that a little thought i can see  i think i can see the value of that but where i am concerned is that this would now  that the elimination of the requirement that there be a historic designation and you know if they dont yet have one i would at least want them to be in the process of doing so because otherwise were investing in businesses that may in a couple of years decide to sell you know we have such scarce dollars that i really think we need to invest in we need to invest our historic preservation dollars in  in businesses and other organizations that are going to  that are going to make a commitment remaining to provide that historical asset and so thats  let me just say that thats a  that would be a major concern for me if that continues to be  continues to not be part of the criteria i just again we have very scarce dollars in this area   110752 am  as in every other and we need to make sure that were investing and folks made a commitment i see it as akin to investing  providing that tax exemption that slight tax assistance  slight tax exemption to those who have historical designation in a couple of instances where people have come forward and  asked for those to be removed weve asked them to pay the money back we made an investment in their property and you know they need to follow through by maintaining   understood those recommendations are really coming forward as part of our effort in terms of outreach and engagement and trust building we could certainly look at potentially moving forward with a model that does not require historic designation in year one and if in fact were to come back for funding require as any   110853 am  additional funding is considered  tovo so in terms of  so from that perspective you would be working to help that  help that property build capacity to do the designation or something like that  well what we are doing is as part of the planning category we are now making it an option to pursue a designation a formal designation utilizing the help of individuals with that level of expertise to assist these organizations in submitting an application they would have to show that they are prequalified through the state or through city for that designation but if they can demonstrate that and their level of tourism then they could potentially be eligible for a grant to pursue that designation formally  tovo i see and i guess you know i mean i  im happy to talk   110954 am  about this more outside this meeting but as i think about it if were providing a grant and we have participants in our programs that are unwilling or uninterested in exploring a historic designation i would just say theyre probably not great candidates for these dollars you know if theyre not willing to make that longterm  that longterm commitment to retaining that historic asset but ill leave that there for now the other thing that i would ask you know in some of our program and this one  this one once upon a time as you looked at the list of recipients year after year some of the same recipients got the dollars and i think that happens in some of our other programs as well and i appreciate  i appreciate the changes that youre implementing i would say though i wonder if we all  if we also ought to have some messaging around this that you know this isnt  these are not going to be longterm  longterm grants i think we sometimes have cultivated an expectation   111056 am  not you specifically not anybody here specifically but have sometimes cultivated a longterm dependence on those city dollars and these really arent designed to be kind of longterm support for historic businesses theyre intended to be kind of seed money to help with a capital project or seed money to help with marketing or seed money to help with something else and im trying to help the council of the future be able to have those conversations in new ways where you know theyre not going to hear from  hear from folks who had gotten that money in the past saying we cant survive without the continued funding i think we just need to set expectations in all of our programs at this point that the city funding is helping you build capacity its helping you get some work done and get to that next point where youre able to bring in different dollars so i dont know if youve addressed that if  there  im not necessarily asking for there to be a specific requirement or something like a prohibition against applying again within a   111157 am  certain amount of time but is  i would ask that there should be some messaging around that that this is  this is a onetime grant there may or may not be opportunities in the future is that something thats come up in the course of your work  all good points yes so one thing that i will say is that while we have increased the contract terms across the spectrum of project types we are requiring that all contracts be completed and in good standing before being able to reapply which is historically what we have found not necessarily the case prior to this program moving over to the city of austin so that is a program requirement now and in addition to that sorry i lost my train of thought  tovo well i think thats interesting  i mean i think thats useful   111257 am  again i would just ask you and your staff and your colleagues to kind of think about how we could  how we could really set that expectation that because you got it once its not going to be year after  or every two year every two year every two year receipt that that  you know were going to continue to support different kinds of organizations and that means not awarding grants to the same applicants within you know every time they  thats open  so the other two things that i wanted to point out is one is that while we dont require a matching requirement we are asking about leveraged investments because were wanting to get a better data snapshot of our investment to any other leveraged monies that an applicant may bring in just to demonstrate that roi secondly while this grant program is open to both nonprofit and forprofit   111359 am  entities since edd has been managing this program 79 of our applicants have  are awardees have been nonprofit applicants and i do very much believe that that is an extension of our outreach and engagement practices and then  well i believe that was it  alter anyone other else have questions okay so you mentioned that there was also potential changes to the 70 thats on city lands who is now  kim mcknight still leading that and  im sorry i didnt see can you speak to whats going on with that program  so i didnt mention any changes to the 70 instead i was restating the   111501 am  percentage allocations that were passed in a council resolution those percentages which indicate 15 of the historic preservation go to the heritage grant 15 to potential historic acquisition and 70 for the maintenance and operation of cityowned historic facility plus any program requirements for heritage grants it also includes staff support for both edd and pard it includes that operational and  maintenance that i  that i mentioned for cityowned historic sites  thank you ms alvarado i think ms mcknight is here in chambers you cant see her i barely saw her here maybe she can speak briefly to the process if you can come up   111607 am  ms mcknight  good morning im kim mcknight the program manager for pard tourism program we do work closely with melissa alvarado on the pard allocation of the historic preservation we understand you have some questions we did prepare a few slide not understanding the breath of your questions we can pull those up briefly and give you an update  i would love to do that if we could just pause a second and take a vote on the airport because i think that we need to make sure we have three and then that will be our last business and then we can do that  no problem we stand ready   were going to pause on this item quickly and take up item 5 the proposed buy law amendments for the airport advisory commission if our clerk would like to speak to that  good morning myrna from the clerks office im here with the airport advisory commission proposed bylaws amendments   111708 am  to edit article iv a officers to add the office of secretary  the officers shall consist of a chair a vice chair and a secretary to edit article b3 duties of officers to add language regarding the secretary so it would read in the absence of the chair and vice chair the secretaries shall perform all duties of the chair the commission would like to ensure continuity of leadership on the dais and they find it helpful to have two videos as backup given the unique hybrid environment where the presiding officer must be present on site it is important to the commission to have a deeper bench of officers as backup to officiate over commission meetings additionally the commission has been operating with an elected secretary for past  the past several years not realizing bylaws   111810 am  didnt provide for that office for staff comments we recommend this  these amendments and im here if you have any questions  thank you councilmember tovo  tovo that sounds fine to me but i do wonder given the need with regard to the shift to hybrid if this isnt something we might make provision for at a more global level not the secretary necessarily but just that the chair or vice chair can designate someone else to chair a particular meeting to do that for all of our boards and commissions i dont know if you have given that any thought or have any language to suggest that might be something one of my colleagues want to bring forward or you want to bring forward for consideration  and that is the practice if the chair or vice chair are not available they will designate a member of the commission however the airport advisory commission requested to have it in their bylaws  tovo terrific thank you  alter do i have a motion councilmember tovo so moves   111912 am   i will second that all those in favor its unanimous on the dais councilmember pool off and councilmember fuentes absent today thank you so we will now go back to ms mcknight if you could pull up her slides please appreciate any insights you can offer you know either about the  any proposed changes or sort of how were thinking about the funding at this stage  sure we really do welcome an opportunity to be here today kim mcknight with parks and recreation manager historic preservation program again we work closely with melissa alvarado and the heritage tourism division on the allocation to pard of the historic preservation fund go to the next slide please melissa went through some of the policy direction i think what i wanted to emphasize to you is that a portion of our operational   112012 am  budget is funded through the historic preservation fund through council direction if you recall as part of the fiscal year 18 actions the council requested that expenditures that were on the general fund that could be funded through historic preservation fund be transferred so i want to point out that a majority of the operational funds that are currently funded through hot were originally general fund we were able to add four fulltime positions as well as some program budget so that we could create our historic preservation program as well as staff the oakwood chapel but everything else was existing and it was done  so i think its an important distinction to make when we talk about our operational funds i  you know added that there were few other actions in fy 18 related to the heritage grant which melissa has covered as well as the direction to require the   112113 am  negro school historic property that were working on next slide please just a reminder that all of the activities projects and programs that are funded with the historic preservation preservation fund in pard to comply with the texas tax code section we take seriously that requirement and well talk a little bit about how we ensure that that is the case next slide please you might be surprised to see that since fiscal year 17 we have been able to direct 19 million to capital projects at parks and recreation which was the intention of council which was that parks and recreation are really an economic engine for our city as you know and it was i think council found it to be fitting that those dollars be reinvested into our park system so happy to report that your vision for this program is happening in terms of the operational   112215 am  expenses as i mentioned our historic museums are funded through the historic preservation fundraiser now they were previously funded through the general fund with the exception of the oak wood chapel that was a new facility that was brought on and through counciladopted cemetery vision plan we were able to you know open the chapel and now it is serving visitors and our community we were also able to provide  theres an ear mark within our facility services for historic properties that need to be  maintained which was again councils intention when they were offsetting general fund with historic preservation fund and because of the direction to  to invest more funding through historic preservation fund which is hotel occupancy tax to pard we were able to create for the first time ever the historic preservation tourism program at parks and recreation which is a program that i manage that   112316 am  includes three fulltime positions to manage the projects that we have initiated the marketing as well as historic designations and signage all tolled the expenditures on the operational side is ten fulltime employees temporary staff as well as program expenses next slide please this is just a snapshot of the historic museums that we operate that are funded through historic preservation we are working hard to ensure that all of these sites are promoted to our tourists and weve got some examples of how we do that but ill also point out that this program has another benefit which is to our community now youll see that the oakwood chapel while were able to promote our exhibits and our site to tourists its also the host of the austin civilian conservation corp program this year so we have it as the home base   112418 am  for  for the job creation program which is  theyre doing museum services and all sorts of work within all of our historic museums and so that is the home base also hosting smithsonian fellows this summer it is the city of austin youth initiatives office also places students in this facility as you probably know the old bakery since the 1970s hosts a senior guild which is seniors over 50 make crafts that are then sold at this visitor facility so just pointing out that we have been able to make a really strong connection between providing for the tourists at the same time providing for our community and were proud to be able to strike that balance next slide please this is the mission of our program very much in line with what melissa laid out for the historic preservation fund use which is to preserve steward activate and promote the historic and cultural   112518 am  resources of our park system next slide please you might be surprised to see that were still not done counting we have an enormous number of historic resources within our park system were in the process of launching historic resource inventory we rival our state parks system with respect to the number of resources certainly theres historic museums and cultural centers but please dont forget that we have cemetery we have golf course we have recreation centers we have senior facilities we have parks that are tremendous cultural landscape we have important people who need to be acknowledged we have parks within historic districts we have a massive system so this marks the first time that weve been able to really provide coordinated you know efforts to preserve and promote and protect next slide please im just going to fly some of the projects that have been funded in part or   112620 am   wholly through historic preservation this is not all of them some of them are still in progress or design but i think youll be again pleased to see that the intended goal of council is really you know coming through were successfully implementing this program oakwood chapel received partial funding through the historic preservation fund completed in 2018 next slide the zilker cafe received funding through the historic preservation fund next slide mayfield park has received funding for numerous projects ranging from a historic restoration of the historic garden sheds as well as extensive masonry and gate repair we do have hopes that we can do full landscape and cottage restoration in the future next slide please just last week we did the dedication and ribbon cutting for downs field historically significant ball field atene austin that has been the home of   112723 am  africanamerican athletics and ill talk about how through our marketing budget we are able to lay the ground work that really helps us with the justification to spend funding on a facility such as this next slide please we are in the process of finishing the restoration at ohenry the historic museum alongside the dickinson in brush square right next to the convention center an ideal project for this fund next slide see home intake facility is going to be open to public later this year this is a terrific example of how we were able to pull in his torque preservation funds to align with some general obligation funds to complete this phase i of this project which i think is going to be so exciting for our community we just cant wait next slide brush square should be starting this summer this is a historic park again right next to the convention center   112824 am  working closely with our museums and our fire department to get this project underway this is a phase i that is really  phase ii would be dependent upon the relocation of the function of the fire station and the ems obviously the building would remain but excited to get phase i underway and again incredible transformation and right in the heart of our sort of visitor district next slide please fiesta gardens has been fully funded through design this is a project that will need to wait on the historic preservation fund to recover for construction funding we had requested the funding with melissa alvarados assistance but obviously with the pandemic hotel occupancy tax was severely impacted and so we will be working with melissa to determine when this project can be fully funded it is almost completely through phase i design phase ii would be the maintenance facility which would hopefully be relocated   112925 am  soon as well stay tuned as we work closely with our partners and heritage tourism to figure out next steps with the site next slide the zilker clubhouse designed as complete were currently in a business phase next slide again barton springs bath house dependent on an injection of funding from the historic preservation fund this is currently in design next slide the elizabeth mcnay museum in  position combination of funding and design is underway this is a project that would replace windows doors and improve the hvac system for the collection which is incredibly important next slide i just want to point out before i talk about these future capital projects that you should expect and it shouldnt be a surprise that a lot of the projects that we had requested budgets for multiple years ago will need more funding were still working to understand the impact of the pandemic on our construction budgets but that is something that weve   113026 am  messaged to economic development their understanding and will be working with us i put this slide up here just to show you that we have a bottomless pit of projects this is just a snapshot of what i was able to kind of come up with staff over the last few years this is our sort of running list but we have an enormous number of projects we have an incredible amount of need so  please note that every year building become you know officially considered historic right now theyve cut off data 1972 which is especially hard for those of us that might be nearing historic age ourselves to understand but please know that we have desperate need the other thing i want to point out is because of this funding it does take pressure off of our general obligation fund now our general obligation fund can fund things that cant be funded through historic preservation fund so this is a unique source of funding that is really only applicable to historic sites that serve tourists as well and so it really has helped   113127 am  i think make our general obligation fund go further and allow us this additional option for funding projects im going to cover next slide please an important part of our program which is our ability to designate properties we have an extreme disparity in the number of properties in certain parts of town that represent underserved and underrepresented communities in terms of their listing to the national register or various historic designations so our program allows us to forge partnerships work on a staffled projects or even fund national register historic designations we are also working to facilitate interpretive signage all over the park system to that end professional historian is able to ensure what we are putting in parkland is accurate and correct this is an important part of our program to ensure that we have these designations in place that were always working to designate new sites through the national   113227 am  register city of austin or historic markers next  and we do have an interpretive signage program im going to fly through some examples of the type of marketing that weve been able to do   gidseg unfortunately were going to have to  i think were going to have to wrap up because  i have an 1130 and whatnot  no problem  definitely want to hear more we werent necessarily prepared for a full presentation  no problem  we are super excited about it  good  i will say that councilmember tovo and i were among the group that helped to push the switch and to steer it over several years and i think all of the examples you gave underscore the importance of this work that we  undertook n retrospect seems obvious but at the time was not at all obvious and has steered so many resources and allowed us to do some really really important work  great  i will say that i think that we are  we would very much still like to see that   113329 am  timeline of whats going  i know i have had a little bit of funding that has gone to may field park lions you know for the five years and understand with lions theres still uncertainty but would like to move through the design phases and its been challenging because we dont have the time line obviously we had some covid pauses and we need to recuperate but it is i think important that we see that timeline and we see that the projects are not just immediately downtown when they are known to be big draws for our tourists and historic  great we stand ready to provide information at any time so happy to circle back with you  great thank you  thanks for your time today  councilmember tovo  tovo chairman will you get this part of the presentation in the backup as well  sure  tovo this is terrific   113430 am  and that overview   please check out the marketing weve been able to do how weve been able to support our equity and diversity goals as well  tovo we can talk about having you back later in the fall i think we all would be really excited to be able to champion these results and were cutting you off not because were not excited about it because of timing  that is absolutely fine  but we are thrilled with work thank you so much  you bet  okay with that i will  i dont think we have to talk about future item it is 1134 and i will adjourn this meeting thank you ')"

colleagues we have three pulled items 52 also 80 81 and also 95 we also have the discussion that folks wanted to have on speakers recognizing speakers we have an executive session and then we have  with four items we have two briefings i thought what we would do is we do the pulled items make sure we discuss anything that might help us on thursday go from the pulled items to the discussion of speakers so that we can have that   91109 am  conversation maybe talk to our clerk and also be ready as we come back after the recess work go into executive session in and around lunch come out of executive session finish any pulled items we still need to do and then go straight into briefings as close to coming out of executive session as we can and if we want to finish the day finishing the conversation on speakers we could do that so lets begin then with pulled items we have  were here in the boards and commissions room we have a quorum present i see natasha on the screen i see her box but i dont see her and council member fuentes is not feeling well this morning not with us   91210 am  probably today   pool and i see the city manager   mayor adler the city manager is also on the screen all right councilmember ellis you pulled youring traffic resolution   ellis i did thank you mayor i pulled my own item because i wanted to make sure if there were any questions that we were able to discuss those today i see the assistant director is here if we have any  but i want to lay out where this conversation came from this is about narrowry targeting traffic enforcement specifically where fatal crashes are occurring and what weve done is we were having some conversations with not only our precinct 3 county constable but also the vision zero program and realizing that although our police department is fully fended we are aware that they are still training up cadets to fill the vacancy they have in the department often times the resources have to be allocated specifically to where crimes are occurring or 911 calls and more high profile   91310 am  situations and that doesnt leave them available to necessarily just be present and be visible and to pull people over for speeding on highways drunk driving other reckless things that are happening specifically in regard to my district areas that kind of overlap closetory the edge of the city limits where we know the constables are very familiar with patrolling over there so we just wanted to see if there were any questions or if transportation department wanted to add any elements to this that they think need to be daylighted to this so its just to ask the city manager to go and look at options where we might be able to come up with some creative solutions with our vision zero programming and i see lewis is now on the screen as well if you would like to say anything lewis i know my office talked with you extensively about this   good morning i am the austin transportation safety officer were basically here to answer any questions and about any context that might be helpful in the discussion   91414 am  today thanks for that   just to reiterate what lewis said were here to answer any questions weve been working with apd and met with the con tables and met with the council offices to talk about a potential agreement with travis county but this resolution is a little bit broader to look at near term strategies and changes were definitely here to answer any questions you may have   ellis thank you   mayor adler it is a resolution to explore opportunities   ellis yes   mayor adler mayor pro tem   alter thank you i want to thank councilmember ellis for drafting this up and im proud to cosponsor this is a question of traffic enforcement and public safety that is longstanding and i think as we have this conversation a little bit of history is really important because this is not a function of changes that were made in 2020 and a function of the staffing   91514 am   crisis we were already dropping in our enforcement levels prior to when i came on to council in 2017 i remember in 2017 there was a huge jump i think it was 2017 there was a huge jump in the receipts that the municipal court was having from traffic enforcement so the issue of how much time were spending doing traffic enforcement how much time we need to be spending that is a longstanding one and i think its really important for context i think that the approach moving forward also is important in that it recognizes that this is about safety its not about raising money its about how do we keep our community safe how do we make sure people are obeying the speed limits so that everyone is safe because those changes of you start getting 15 miles above the speed limit which we do see five miles ever little   91616 am  bit makes a difference for safety in our community so i just wanted to provide that history so that we understand this is a longstanding problem i think its an innovative solution i appreciate our staff and i appreciate the constables creativity and thinking about ways that we can do this in a way that target us on our most problematic areas thank you   mayor adler the history is helpful councilmember pool   pool this is a really good resolution and i look forward to supporting it i wanted to draw attention to the be it further resolved item that talks about contracting with the constables and  indiscernible an interlocal agreement with travis county i think thats really important the city of austin taxpayers pay taxes to travis county and the enforcement is historically outside of the   91717 am  city limits so we are effectively funding the constables but not necessarily getting as much service from those resources and i really would urge our staff to negotiate that item very carefully i do think there is the ability for travis county to step up its enforcement within the city of austin confines not only outside of the city of austin city of austins boundary lines so i really like that particular be it further resolved i would point to the fact that i worked for constable 5 for a number of years before running for city council so i have a sense of the work that is done in those offices and i also understand the budgeting structures that theyre structure and how they go about crafting their budget so this is a good time to go in and have those conversations with constable 3 certainly but i would urge it to be even broader   91817 am  specifically constable five which has the jurisdiction for all of the central part of the city so thanks very much for bringing this up i appreciate it   ellis thank you for that and i know theres also been some discussions with precinct 4 i know this is happening on all outskirts and would absolutely welcome the conversation being about all of the precincts and we also wrote it to be very narrowly crafted so it wasnt just pulling people over for  taillights and other minor infractions very very focused on the high rate of speeding and the fatalities and those types of crashes   pool absolutely and simply having a visible presence will go a long way to deter people to remind them that there are children at play and there are folks walking and other people driving so just to increase the level of awareness for those people who are driving and potentially breaking laws with speeding   ellis absolutely some of yall may remember it was a couple of months ago but there was a car going down a street in my   91918 am  district at a very high rate of speed about 80 or 90 miles per hour i think the individual was maybe 19 years old it jumped the curb ended up in a tree over the sidewalk that people happen to use to walk to the neighboring middle school so it was definitely something that impacted the community greatly and i know everybody would like to see people slow down be a little bit more careful with the way that theyre driving   mayor adler councilmember kelly   kelly thank you i was going to actually say the same point that councilmember pool said that the constables can and will stop you for traffic enforcement and this really amplifies the presence and for safety were going to go a long way to getting back to our goal of safer roads i appreciate this item councilmember ellis and thank you so much for bringing this forward   mayor adler thank you for that its good as were looking at public safety that were trying to explore all different options to be able to do public safety as effectively as we can   92020 am  i noticed in the media yesterday that dallas is moving towards the same kind of increased reporting of events over the internet rather than having police officers responding to take reports for many of the reasons that our police chief said he thought that would be a better use of peoples time its interesting that now that thats being picked up in other places so thank you for that what about next item item 80 and 81 councilmember tovo you pulled this one   tovo the statesman tract   tovo thanks mayor i can be really quick on this i am asking staff or i will request a postponement on this we do not yet have an ordinance this is a very big very complex rezoning planned unit development rezoning   92120 am   and i think its appropriate that both the council and the public have an opportunity to really review that that ordinance prior to voting on it on second reading   council member if i may add we do have a postponement request that we received from south river city citizens association so its from wendy price todd it is the first request from a neighborhood and theyre requesting a postponement to the next meeting on july 28th   tovo i understand that but i think in this case i would have requested a postponement anyway since we didnt have the ordinance so i would regard it as a postponement either from staff or council   mayor adler councilmember kelly   kelly yeah i remember back when we had these discussions one of the only reasons i voted in favor of the item was to initiate that ordinance does staff have an estimate of when we might have that available for review   the ordinance i just spoke to the law department this morning hopefully well have a draft possibly by tomorrow but its a very lengthy complicated ordinance its 20 pages long   kelly i would appreciate time to review   92221 am  that so i think a postponement is appropriate thank you councilmember tovo   mayor adler yes council member   pool just to confirm the postponement is at the councils request   on thursday well see who makes a motion but yes thats my understanding right now   tovo mayor we do have some other stakeholders who want to know  kind of get a sense of the councils will on this so i would appreciate hearing from my colleagues but i also want to just ask the staff weve had various conversations including most extensively as a council last fall in december when we talked about the south central wastewater we also requested  waterfront we also requested to have the financial documents provided to all the council the different analysis of what had been done with the south central waterfront plan traction increment refinancing  reinvestment zone and so i know that my office has now gotten those files im not sure if every   92322 am  council office has gotten those files but i do think as were talking about the balance of affordable housing in particular and the other kinds of amenities that are part of this i think we need to have a council discussion about is it i did request a meeting with eco northwest and we were told that we requested it i would have to look back at when but we were told they couldnt meet before thursday but i do think we need to have that conversation here as well about those financial assumptions that the developer is referencing as theyre talking about affordable housing and its percentage so my request is also that we make sure that every council office has those documents if they want to review it but also that we make space when this comes back to us before this comes back to us that we make space in our  july meeting to talk about those financial assumptions perhaps with the consultant i think there were several consultants who have looked at the financial assumptions for this area   92427 am   assistant city manager rodney gonzalez yes we will confirm that every council member has received those financial documents ill get with jerry and rosie as oh to you we can carve out that time that youre requesting for council to discuss those analysis   mayor adler theres also a broader conversation too i agree we need to see those numbers so that people can analyze those as we went through the numbers for the district and looked at the tirz funding it was apparent that staff was coming back and saying all the things that you want to have in here theres not the money to be able to get to and part of this i think relates to the regulating plan in terms of what it is thats going to be developed in the area but i know going back to assumptions that were discussed when the plan was originally discussed going back five six years ago there were certain height that were proposed for the buildings that were in this area and i think it was like   92528 am  200 300 400foot of height id also like to take a look at what would happen if we increase the height of those buildings generally in this area which i see as an extension of downtown and i think it will develop that way i think in the next 20 30 years its going to feel that way but if the height were not 200 300 400 but 300 400 500 or 400 500 and 600 i would like to know what that does to the tirz financing and whether that gives us the ability to be able to raise the money on a tirz that would fund all of the affordable housing that we would otherwise want in that area and if it does then i think thats a choice that ought to come back to the council for the council to be able to see rather than getting into an assumption that is older and perhaps made in a different time period and i dont know how to  i dont know how to throw that into the mix   92629 am  can you help with that   sure if i could because all these issues are really intertwined youve got of course the south central waterfront plant you have the tirz as you mentioned youve got the regulating plan and of course whats in front of council is the statesman pud it may be that we collectively get together with finance and of course with rosie and jerry to talk about the tirz in general just kind of like a council refresh the assumptions that went into the tirz analysis including the height and you may recall that the most recent analysis was updated by charles heimsath and then of course we also talked about the regulating plan what the current status what were contemplating in that regulating plan and then of course talk about the financial analysis associated with the statesman pud so i can get with staff about just how that collective briefing would look ahead of the consideration for the statesman pud very likely it would be at that same council meeting and so we would want to of course have that discussion first but i could get with staff    92729 am  about all those matters that you and councilmember tovo had brought up   mayor adler to address the issues and also to lay out a calendar for when its anticipated that we will be able to resolve and hear those issues that would be helpful councilmember pool   pool yeah i had talked with acm gonzalez and the city manager about requesting a briefing on both the eco northwest and the eps or  not esp   not esp   although we all wish we had esp so that we could all get a sense of what was contained in those reports see what any  where they align with one another where the differences may fall so that we can get a more indepth understanding of the financials which is an unusual place for us to be to have this level of data and information and i really appreciate that because i agree with my colleagues here that this conversation is a really important one and it will take us digging   92831 am  into the details in order to render the most appropriate and positive result i think for the future of the city   and if i could council member that analysis was  will also include the comparison of the eco northwest from 2020 to the recent eps analysis so that way you can see the differences   pool that is excellent i think that would be really helpful i understand that that couldnt happen today because the principals werent available but it maybe could happen were you saying in july   we anticipate in july and of course the principals arent here as well we havent received the final draft theres some back and forth between staff to make sure that everything that theyve put into the draft is as accurate as possible so we want to work with them in between now and that discussion to finalize that document   pool i appreciate that thank you so much thanks mayor   mayor adler councilmember kitchen   kitchen yes i want to respond to councilmember tovos question i also support postponement   92932 am  i think its important for us to have the documents so that we can read through them and also agree with what others have said i think understanding the financial analysis for the affordable housing is important and so i look forward to getting that information   yes councilmember kelly    kelly i just want to talk about the previous question about the ordinance and when it will be ready is there any way you can send it to council where we can review it or is there a place online where we can put all this information where the public can see it and review it and give feedback   yes we can do that ahead of the posting   mayor adler okay anything else on this item all right well move on  yes mayor pro tem   tovo can i ask if anybody has a concern about a postponement   mayor adler i dont it seems appropriate to me that there be a postponement i had heard it was going to be a neighborhood postponement but i hear what youre saying is you   93033 am  dont want it charged to the neighborhood since the ordinance isnt back is that correct   tovo yes   mayor adler okay anything else   pool i wanted to    alter i wanted to clarify one of our presentations is still on that were still getting a presentation today on this   tovo its a different planned unit development   alter its a different one okay   mayor adler different pud councilmember harpermadison   harpermadison thank you chair i appreciate it i dont in fact have any problem with the postponement in fact i appreciate it very much i support it i agree that this timeline has been relatively confusing i feel like we absolutely need more time to really truly wrap our heads around this very complex proposal and the potential implications for our community longterm i always always try to think about what my baby said what will austin look like in 2080   93134 am  so i want to make sure that as we approach this complex proposal we really recognize how it fits into the larger south central waterfront vision future facing austin so i really appreciate you taking the opportunity to pump the brakes i think we really needed to thank you for your leadership councilmember tovo   mayor adler so rodney when you have that presentation not only a presentation on where we are and what weve seen but what the impact would be if we increase the height that we had talked about on those issues even if its just a general feel   ill get with edmund and kim they work closely with charles heimsath to do the assumptions and if there were some concerns well certainly relay those to council ahead of the presentation    mayor adler okay thanks councilmember tovo   tovo but just to begin  i think this is pretty meaty complicated financial analysis so i really want to be sure that were  that that is getting a lot of attention because just looking through   93235 am  i think  i think independently looking through these different financial analyses is pretty challenging to try to go from that to what the applicant is saying is and is not possible so i would just ask that its fine to look at other scenarios but could we please first start by really understanding what scenarios theyve modeled and how that  what that suggests in terms of affordable housing and parks and other things   certainly and if i could offer a distinction what the mayor is talking about with regard to height is overall tirz analysis which is not the one that eps is doing for us thats a separate one that kim and ed are working with charles heimsath on for the analysis specific to the statesman thats one that rosie and jerry are working with eps on and so youre going to see that as a separate analysis from what the mayor has been asking for   tovo i think too though some of the earlier anol cease some of the earlier  analyses some of the earlier financial analyses that form the basis for the south central   93336 am  assumptions are also being cited as were going through this budget so it all is intermixed i just want to sort of start by understanding the analyses for what is currently on  in the plan   absolutely well do our best to come with that briefing to make sure we have these distinctions so council can is have a full discussion on those matters you talked about   mayor adler yeah and they have different but they are interrelated its hard for me to know what i want this developer to do without knowing what it is we can do absent the developer doing them that might prioritize what it is that i want this developer to do if were otherwise able to take care of some of those things and theres different things that i might want to be asking the developer to do our tirz enables us to  the public to do some of the things that are a public benefit so both  theyre different information but for me theyre interrelated on this question thats in front of us now yes mayor pro tem   93437 am   alter so from what ive seen on this pud i think its still very far from being ready for us to vote on not just for the postponement theres not only the financial side but theres also the substance of whats in the pud im particularly concerned about the parkland and what were delivering with respect to the parkland and what is expected of him i think its really unclear in the material that we have seen and i think if were going to start talking about different heights which may be appropriate here this should not be a fly by the night 1200 am discussion that we have and so we should really think about  whether we need to schedule some dedicated time to looking at this i think it rises to that level of importance for our city and we should think about whether we need not only dedicated time in the work session but a council   93539 am  meeting that is focused on that so the community can come speak to us in a clear way and that we can focus in on the changes the july meeting is traditionally a very heavy meeting as is the august meeting and im not saying we cant deal with it at all then but i think we do need to give our space to have a process that leads to good decisions   mayor adler okay anything else i think it might very well be something that we need to take a look at thank you anything else on this item okay i pulled the next item councilmember tovo and i pulled it just to  because i was in your quorum but i just wanted to elevate that conversation you and i have had a chance to talk about this and i fully expect us to be able to agree to language to assuage my concern this is obviously an   93640 am  historic area that needs to be looked at so i dont have any problem with initiating the historic district that youre talking about at the same time we passed a resolution last week that councilmember harpermadison brought that was perhaps taking a look at other issues that may or may not be contained within the initiated historic district and i just wanted to make sure that we werent superseding or losing track of that earlier resolution and that by doing this we werent limiting the kinds of things that could be part of the conversation recognize the benefit of us sexually initiating some work but not predetermining what the ultimate conclusions would be   tovo thank you mayor so you had suggested some language that would have added in something along those lines that its not superseding or displacing it and that its initiating a broader conversation and i   93741 am  had indicated im comfortable with that kind of language where you and i need to spend more time talking is about the local historic district because i do think that this is the vehicle by which we achieve what was described in last weeks resolution there was a passage ill call your attention to talking about in the second be it further resolved it directs the manager to prepare a code amendment and then point a of that talks will allowing a structure of building hyatt of 140 feet or whatever is allowed under the capitol view corridor and then the next passage talks about creating design standards with specific guidelines for the preservation of facades on historic structures to ensure any redevelopment is compatibility with the character of the historic district those design guidelines get created through a local historic district and then when i looked back at the letter that we have from the  i believe it was  give me a minute    93848 am  i thought i had seen something in one of the letters in any case it is in the downtown austin alliances letter that they sent us on june 7th advocating in support of these amendments they note too for the structures to be compatibility with the historic sixth street district the redevelopment plan should comply with the city of austin historic design standards and they talk about maintaining the step back so it been awhile since weve talked about a local historic district im glad jerry is here if people have questions but that is what happens in the process of constructing a local historic district the property owners in that area have a great role in helping shape and suggest what those design standards are going to be theres a pretty standard set that can be modified but i think its in concert with the language that you   93949 am  added that was quite general about planning i think that is the vehicle for the planning and the historic area   mayor adler i appreciate im still in your quorum i think we will be involved in the language that is in this item expected to be really an issue on their   tovo great thank you was there anything that needed to add jerry or that wasnt accurate about the local historic district   no one of the main functions of a local historic district is to establish design standards in the past most commonly has been residential design standards but theres no reason it could be be commercial so i think that the  there is overlap between the resolution that passed yesterday and what  on last week and what a local historic district does   mayor adler how does that work when its initiated by the council and not the neighborhood    the way i would take this resolution and correct me if im wrong is for staff to go out and do the work related to a local historic district but the way its   94051 am  set up it requires that 51 of the property owners petition for the creation of a district so we would work with the property owners if this resolution were to pass on what a district means and to see if they support it   so we really cant initiate we can    mayor adler you cannot create   mayor adler we can encourage the neighborhood to initiate   the actual creation of a district requires the consent of the property owners and we would bring that to once we have that consent we would bring it to the city council for approval    mayor adler okay   tovo but it is the structure through which the design standards  i mean it usually yields a set of design standards which is already what the council has initiated or in last weeks initiation it called for the construction of design standards   it always results in the establishment of design standards   tovo one way or the other its all  the design standards are  have to be created   yes   mayor adler but that would assume  and in this   94153 am  case i dont think it may be an issue but wins we cant do it and it requires the neighborhood 50 plus one percent of the area if 50 plus one percent of the area doesnt want to do it they say we cant agree on standards and we just dont want to do it we cant force that or otherwise initiate that ourselves the only way we would be able to attach heights or other stuff would be through a different initiated process that we can initiate   yes it could be through straightup code amendments go to the code and create a special area for sixth street that has its own set of regulations it could also be done through a local historic district with design standards that is the same thing a similar thing had in clarksville many years ago the council created a local historic district and then immediately said now go make one in clarksville and we had to explain to the city council that the process that they created actually back then it required more   94255 am  than 51 so we had to tell council member dunkerley at the time that the ordinance that the council had just passed actually was a come from below type process as opposed to a come from above but yeah so this would say staff shall work with the property owners in the area on the idea of the greystone district and see where it goes from there but youre right there are two ways we could have design standards we could have the regulations through the code they could be through a district frankly through both that would run parallel side by side   mayor adler and its just that variations that i wanted to allow for recognizing that this is a really historic area and im really comfortable with us leading in that process   tovo thanks im going to look back at the language about initiation   mayor adler okay   tovo but thank you for your  thank you for what i think i hear as support for moving forward   mayor adler councilmember kelly   94355 am    kelly thank you i also was curious to know how this might affect the previous resolution that we passed last week so thank you for bringing that up when it comes to historic designations traditionally at least from what i can see its not been the will of the council to force the homework business owner 62 that decision so thank you for explaining that process my question here for councilmember tovo is is there anything written in the language of your resolution i apologize to not having it up here to look at is there anything that requires staff to come back to council in the event that the owners decide not to move forward with the historic designation because i think that would be helpful for us to get a report back from staff on    tovo so these come back to council for approval that would have to come back to council before we could consider or vote on the design standards that would   94455 am  attach   kelly i guess what im trying to say is if the business owners are not wanting to move forward is there anything that will create an opportunity for staff to report back to us on that   tovo not specifically so i guess  it would be helpful so that we could consider other options for making sixth street historically designated if thats the route the council wants to go   tovo sure ill think about that i mean currently it is a national register historic district so there is an historic district and if you want to put up a sign you have to go to the board of adjustment and get certain provisions and there are  you know there are a host of historic design guidelines that apply  standards that apply in that area the conversation now is about whether those should be adapted based on last weeks  i mean the council voted to say were willing to initiate changes to those   94557 am  for this  for this redevelopment for this property owner so i guess in answer to your question we can certainly put in there something that asks for a report back about what stream realtys disposition is towards it since they are a 61 property owner along sixth street as i understand it   kelly i think that would be helpful just to our knowledge   mayor adler well go to councilmember harpermadison but it might allow the same thing to be done by just making amendments to the combining district overlay that currently exists that might be an additional route that might be set up for what was done last week i dont know that that would be the right way might be an alternative way but councilmember harpermadison did you raise your hand   harpermadison i did you guys will have to forgive me hopefully somebody in the room can identify the tooth   94658 am   pain its maybe the worst feeling ever so im going to be relatively quiet how will this resolution affect the  i absolute appreciate and understand councilmember tovos resolution and mayor your support to make sure we take the necessary steps moving forward for preservation of a special historic district but i guess my questions include how does the local historic district compare to the national historic district which we already have in place what are the implications what information should we be sharing with the general public when they ask questions about whats the difference what does the local historic district imply i especially want to be able to speak to folks in my district for whom you know we have multiple nationally registered and acknowledged assets in district 1 but there doesnt seem to be    94801 am  you know i wont go into that i will ask if we can find out what are the implications of the local historic district what are the implications of this resolution in comparison to the one we passed last week by way of time line for progress and then what information should we be sharing with our constituents when they ask questions about what a local historic district would do and then lastly this is more of a comment than it is a question youll notice that i try to be careful about saying  and this was the feedback that we got from our constituents and i cant say that i disagree with them you know weve changed multiple things that we say so we dont call it  what did we used to call it now i just refer to it as public  oh citizen communication so we changed that which were phasing out the use of the word master in terms of planning and other things   94902 am  i think we should consider as a body recognizing that  i dont know if you guys are receiving the same feedback but im receiving feedback when we use expressions like northern arkansas character that thats  neighborhood characters thats code for something else and i cant entirely disagree i would just like to put that on the table that we consider if theres an alternative to saying neighborhood character the preservation of character i think for a lot of folks that translates into something offensive all that said i would like to know the questions that i asked before and the fourth question would be what happens if we dont get back 51 of the businesses that this would affect what if we dont get that 51 that want this designation in which case i appreciate the commentary from councilmember kelly so looking forward to the continued conversation but on its face i dont see why   95002 am  this would be in conflict with the resolution we brought forward   mayor adler jerry do you want to answer some of those questions   tovo councilmember harpermadison i dont see it in conflict your resolution asks for the creation of design standards     harpermadison if i said that what i was asking is how does it work in combination with what it is that we brought forward in terms of the time line for progress not conflict that isnt what i meant   tovo got it i think of the staff if we can initiate it this week i see it in sync in terms of time line the other questions are probably better fielded by assistant director rusthoven but in terms of whether or not it is in sync in terms of focus i think it is a mechanism for doing what youve described in terms of design guidelines   councilmember i agree i   95103 am  think we can do both of these because they are both trying to achieve the same goal we can do them side by side and i dont see one slowing down the other   mayor adler anything else on this yes councilmember ellis   kelly i    ellis i have a question if there is a bottom up approach where people who own these structures that can initiate this process on their own why would we as a council to create on our own and ask them to like it it just seems like if the owners could do this on their own why are we not letting them know of that opportunity and just advising them that they can come request it   i believe that a lot of things as councilmember tovo stated a lot of things directing us to work on new site development regulations for sixth street but also consider design in that   95206 am  process the local historic district thats exactly what its all about their historic structures and how to set standards for the redevelopment or improvements to those structures so i think that both of these things theres a lot of overlap frankly between these two things again i think we could go about it frankly either way or both there could be an application for local historic district that could come from the property owners again what i think this resolution to do is to not actually create the district because as has been stated that requires council approval and it does require the acquiescence of the property owners side by side to that we have the resolution passed last week that said look at new site development regulations for sixth street   95306 am  and i frankly see this as being one or the other or both and so what i see if this passes given what passed last week this is direction to consider both and consider what the advantages and disadvantages are to having some  two processes or two things happen side by side   kelly it seemed to me the one we passed last week seemed more in line with you know going to work with the property owners and figuring out what design standards might work and maybe they are  the same thing and this is a moot point but i would hate for us to end up in a situation where your staff has put in hours and hours of work and then the property owners dont buy into it and dont necessarily want  they dont want to get over that 50 plus one percent in this day and age i would hated for staff to be working on things that dont pan out in the long run because i know everybody has a lot on their plate right now and i want to be respectful of that   i very much appreciate that trust me i do i think a lot of this work   95408 am  would be done either way given what passed last week so i think it would not result in a duplication of work   mayor adler councilmember harpermadison   harpermadison thank you mayor i appreciate that councilmember ellis you just brought about another question i had forgotten i was also wondering  so what i was along the lines what i was thinking earlier we have some assets in district 1 that have been  the district for facility has been designated historic and operated as a barrier for forward progress for some of our owners private owners of buildings that have been established historic and within a certain district nccd im recognizing that we are more and more having to help constituents navigate through the implication of the additional regulations and that was the other question that i have you know how do  when we   95509 am  receive  because inevitably we will receive questions from our constituents who are business owners in the sixth street district if it does become a local historic district what are the additional regulations im not asking you to answer that today mr rusthoven i was just adding that to my list that makes five questions thank you   mayor adler councilmember tovo   tovo theres one person division this week and last week last weeks code amendments are specific to the two blocks that would further the question of stream realty this would be a more holistic you know in the last paragraph of this resolution mayor you had language about last weeks  about additional small area planning or process because you know if year initiating  the council has initiated changes to those two blocks i think the question is you know what are the guidelines going to be for that district more generally   95610 am  and so this is  i mean what is happening as part of last weeks resolution is not  is not a planning effort for the whole historic district it asks for design guidelines but those guidelines need to be for the whole sixth street district not just those two blocks thats an important consideration its been a while since we talked about a local historic district those were designed to get away from the kind of  investment that it took from the city staff in working through individual landmark cases and so i think that our advantage is to it i also want to go back and talk about the initiation because im not sure that thats exactly true that the council cant but its certainly true that onwithout the  you know without the cooperation councilmember harpermadison you asked are we instituting a set of regulations that are going to be cumbersome the property owners themselves are involved in   95711 am  the conversation around those design guidelines there are set design guidelines that are modified and so they would have an active role and frankly it would be almost certainly unlikely to pass if theres not strong buyin from the property owners   mayor adler councilmember kelly   kelly i know were talking about the property owners im wondering councilmember tovo have you had conversations with any of them and what extent and what feedback have you gotten   tovo so the major property owner is stream realty they own 61 i have talked with mr suttle about it and reached out to kaitlin ryan last week but shes not responded   kelly could you share with us some of the feedback that you got   tovo sure i do this carefully so im going to read back the text from mr suttle before i posted it weve had subsequent conversations and i dont know we dont usually have   95813 am  speakers here at the work session so i wont invite him to speak but  this is last friday before it posted initial reaction is if it can go fast and design standards make sense it may be okay   kelly okay thank you   tovo after my discussion ill characterize my discussion with mr suttle this morning in my conversations  ill give you my impression in my conversations with stream realty i sensed that  i believe that they are very committed to the historic fabric of sixth street and support the national register historic district and have respect for it and desire to enhance thats the impression i got from my meetings with them that they desire their development to really enhance the national register historic district not to kind of prompt a major redevelopment of sixth street that would  that   95913 am  would you know result in a loss of historic structures and historic  and that historic landscape and so you know as i see this action i think its very much in concert with what i understood to be their commitment to the historic integrity of that area   kelly thank you for explaining that    tovo but again im trying to choose my words carefully because i dont want to characterize their disposition on it but thats where  thats how those things align   kelly have you spoken with constituents and gotten feedback   tovo ive spoken to a lot of constituents as there have been conversations in the public i have heard from constituents and others who are frankly wondering how the redevelopment  the pretty major redevelopment of those two blocks could impact the rest of it and whether we will next see requests to you know demolish additional structures up and down sixth street and what that really means in terms of the citys   100014 am  disposition toward that national register historic district i dont think weve heard a lot of those concerns but i can tell you they are out there from members of the preservation committee the business community others who want to support this redevelopment but want to be sure it happens within a structure that acknowledges this area is an historic district and needs to be treated differently than green field   kelly thank you   mayor adler okay   tovo thanks for the questions   mayor adler any other questions on this item yes councilmember ellis   ellis i think this is a really interesting conversation so i just would say on thursday when people are signed up to speak it might be helpful if theres any folks that are in favor or have concerns just  i want to be respectful of the way that this is being council initiated when it seems like typically its a you know owner initiated just since its my first time through this it would be helpful to have that to anyone who is interested in speaking to that   100114 am   mayor adler my hope is with the item being postponed i dont know what the processes will be for community engagement on something like this   tovo which item postponed mayor   mayor adler you are right sorry i was confused all right so    tovo and i would just say in answer to my colleague councilmember ellis im going to look at the code because i think there have been strong if not actual initiations strong proactive actions from the council that have resulted in local historic work happening i also see this as very different from others because what the action the council took last week was initiating code amendments for a particular property owner and so i think it is  i think it is in line again in line with the general process thats been set in place here for the council to take an action   mayor adler all right    100215 am  councilmember harpermadison   harpermadison sorry about that one last question i just heard councilmember tovo in her last commentary just before councilmember ellis i used the word demolition while were asking people to speak to specific points on thursday id like very much for somebody to speak about the implications of the  or use of the word demolition i think when people hear that they hear us clearing out all the historic buildings on sixth street so i want to be explicit about our use of words that scare people when we talk about demolition i want to make sure were being very clear about what we mean when we say that does that mean we are demolishing a building thats condemned or cant be built around and were preserving the facade and going to reintroduce that to new construction does that mean were going to take the historic buildings that exist now and   100316 am  build above and around them and preserve the historic  i would like for somebody to speak to the specific implications about the use of the word demolition thank you   tovo mayor i made an amendment to your resolution last week that asks for that  for the property owner to do just that very work as the code amendments proceed ive got a list of proposed demolitions and thats their language that theyve provided to me in terms of addresses of the buildings that they have proposed demolishing and so there is likely additional conversation that needs to happen about exactly how that works with their redevelopment but that is in essence what theyve proposed doing and as we look at the rest of the street yes i think we do need to be really clear about  about when and how those would be  demolitions would be considered   mayor adler   100417 am  councilmember ellis   ellis thank you mayor i would just add to your list any tax implications i dont know if thats covered under the historic district but if theres any difference with the local historic district about tax implications i want to be mindful of that   mayor adler okay all right so weve taken care of now all of the pulled items parenthetically councilmember fuentes the reason she is not here is because she has covid she wanted me to announce that because as councilmembers were out in the public a lot and she just wants everybody to know that in case they were around her over the last  last couple days all right weve now handled all the pulled items anything else councilmember tovo   tovo yes councilmember fuentes im sorry to hear that and hope you have a speedy recovery    100518 am  i want to ask staff to look at 25242 the initiation of zoning or rezoning i believe that the council  i think that the local historic district works like any other code amendment or any other rezoning in that the council can initiate it but perhaps we can take a careful look at it   mayor adler okay anything else councilmember harpermadison   harpermadison mayor i want to make sure that im not  how the process should work here but the opportunity material to speak about speed enforcement and i know there were at least a couple folks in the ada community who were looking forward to me doing some advocacy around traffic violence and just sharing a few words if its appropriate for me to go back now i will   mayor adler it would be fine   harpermadison thank you i appreciate that   100619 am  i just wanted to put highlights around the fact you know my family has been very severely impacted by traffic violence i know theres work being done by kathie sitolik in the mueller district her nephew was victim of traffic violence also you know somebody just going too fast so i fully embrace the idea that we need to do a lot more when it comes to making our streets and roadways safer places for all users i had a really great conversation yesterday tense but great conversation yesterday with some constituents who have concerns around general traffic and mobility safety and i real appreciate that our constituents are asking and that were answering the call nobody should have to suffer a traumatic injury or lose their life during the simple course of getting from point a to point b ill point out my family suffering over the years it never stops for some families right sometimes its brief and painful and you know then   100720 am  theres the grieving and sometimes it just lasts forever with my familys situation just a forever situation that compromised my family members abilities and having to address that you know just thinking somebody was just going too fast right and we can do better is something that  this is something thats really important to me so i appreciate the item being brought forward i think longterm goals should really be implementing safer designs that encourage safer behaviors and modes i want to point out something that i know members of my neighborhood and subsequently my constituents get frustrated about whenever theres a ball game at ut everybody parks in our neighborhood the streets are completely lined for blocks at a time with cars of people that walk over to the ball field and i know that folks are upset about you know the cars park everywhere but i personally real like theres cars parked everywhere because otherwise my road is like you know a highway its so wide and people go   100823 am   so fast all our pets our kids our elderly everybody is at risk when people are flying down this residential street just to get to a stop yard 50 yards ahead its ridiculous and frankly irresponsible so i appreciate watching those traffic calming measures that get introduced whatever it is that we can do you know if its allowing parking on the street if its you know more speed humps whatever we can do to really encourage safer design i think thats where we start i think that frankly is easier than changing human behavior so really looking forward to being a part of that robust dialogue moving forward i am fully aware how traffic enforcement also has disproportionately affected black and brown experiences my family has also been severely impacted by the   100925 am  disproportionate outcomes with racial profiling and some of the other elements that happen when people the bottom rung people existing in poverty i say all the time its expensive to be pool and people riding dirty when that happens that snowball effect all the things that get affected by way of that disproportionate enforcement thats something we all should be taking into  we all need to be thinking about implications for constituents with traffic enforcement so i want to be sure moving forward were building in safeguards to really prevent racial profiling and gratuitous stops we know they happen even you know the crow report and some of the other reporting weve had along the way implies that we have some growing to do there so i hope as a community all of us grow in that way so im proud of the revised training that were implementing i know its been implied that we have more work to do   101026 am  and i think theres always more work to do i look forward to doing it i think you know at our police academy like weve all discussed thats the start and if we can get the start right i think the outcomes are better for everybody i look forward to getting the start right and better outcomes i would expect that anyone who patrols our streets you know i know a lot of our constables and you do too they work so hard i would expect anybody working the streets on our dime would have the same training and thats the last thank i would leave you with i think its comprehensive and robust so thank you councilmember i appreciate you bringing it forward mayor   mayor adler councilmember renteria   renteria a short comment ive been asking for a speed bump i have a street that i live on that runs about three blocks long ive been asking for one for   101126 am  five years now so i recommended to any councilmember that wants a speed bump in their district to start early because i still havent gotten mine  laughter    be careful what you wish for   mayor adler all right lets go move forward weve done all the pulled items lets move to speakers before we go into executive session councilmember tovo you had wanted to get us back to work session on this   tovo i did and i think somewhere i have the language the code language so i think  i think a few things have shifted as weve moved back and forth in between hybrid and virtual and inperson meetings one of the things that i pointed out last week is that the rules are actually  and the ordinance that we use to adopt the  approve the   101227 am  rules actually says its the first 20 individuals on a particular agenda item not on the agenda more fully so i think that was a little bit of the conversation we were having last week mayor is that the rules that weve approved are really about making sure that each individual agenda item if there are a huge number of speakers the reductions happen within that agenda item not overall thats one thing i wanted to clarify but i also would like and if were pressed for time today may not be the day to do it but i would like to figure out how in this hybrid system we get back to hearing commentary on issues like in chunks i find it really really confusing on the consent agenda and on the zoning agenda when we are jumping back and forth on issues it makes it hard to follow i can follow it but i think it makes it more challenging   101327 am  when were switching among speakers and among different issues i know theres challenges are how the clerk pulls those folks that that we need to better understand but the real  the main issue i wanted to address today is the speaking the speaking times because i think weve lost track of what that rule really was   mayor adler okay lets talk about speaking times in particular when we have broader conversations about groups i think its  you know we can see what the council wants to do because obviously well do whatever you know the majority of the dais wants to do for me i like having the comments in the morning because i think it helps speakers be able to sign up and speak and they dont have to wait all day and then ive heard people say that they prefer that ive also heard other people wanting to come in its easier to do time management in meetings when  when we have all the speakers as   101427 am  weve been doing it so i think that there are pros and cons so when we get into that conversation well do whatever the council wants to do but we can focus todays conversation on the amount of time we give to speakers to speak    tovo just to clarify i wasnt really suggesting when we do it in the course of the day necessarily i was talking about can we strive for organizing the speakers so that they are talking about  so we dont have somebody on issue number 1 and then issue number 8 and then back to 1 and on to 9   mayor adler oh i see   tovo it goes  and the same thing happens with zoning and its just  it makes it much more challenging for speakers not to repeat what the previous person  theres a building on the narrative that just happens differently when you have all of the speakers on one item talking in a clump i know thats widely challenging with the virtual so i dont know how to solve for that i dont know if we can solve for it but we can solve for the   101529 am  speakers who are in person potentially and i did find the language i was seeking and that is in 119 of our procedures manual it is the first 20 speakers on an agenda item get three minutes each and then the subsequent speakers get one minute unless we alter it or unless you propose something different and then we have the ability to as a council override it but it was again just an agenda item not overall i think thats a really important  whatever the time frames we end up are i think its important because we have agenda items that are going to pass but there are 30 people who come down and want to speak to it and if they are the first 30 people to sign up they would be truncating everybody elses time on all the other items and one or two speaking on item 10 they are only at one minute because there was another item on the agenda really   101631 am  popular i dont think thats in concert with what we were trying to do in terms of managing the et cetera moo i dont think we intended to truncate peoples times if there were a ton of speakers on one of them   mayor adler what weve been doing and we dont have to stay there is we  in order to avoid that weve been giving everybody the same amount of speaking time whether they are the first speaker or the last speaker but generally speaking we have varied the amount of time that speakers have based in part on the number of speakers that have signed up so as to keep us you know generally speaking within an hour or two of speaker time in the morning or an hour or two in speaker time in the afternoon never having less than one minute never having more than three minutes but trying to stay within that variation within that hour to twohour period of time   101732 am  so thats how weve been setting it but we could certainly  we could certainly vary from that so if we have you know 20 speakers that have signed up we give them three minutes to speak if we have any speakers that have signed up it goes down to a minute each except for those things that council has said this is really important and we want to have more time for speakers to speak to this particular issue  in which case we have varied that to say if you are speaking on those numbers then you have three minutes to speak thats the practice weve been following for the last  since the pandemic   tovo i guess it wasnt apparent that we were not following our speaker rules on that front until we had the situation last week where we  where so many of the speakers were for one or two items again i guess i think   101834 am  that  i think we want to be able to hear from the public and hear as many different viewpoints as possible and when you have 40 you know multiple multiple people on one item it just makes sense if we have to limit it makes sense to limit on the items where you have many speakers rather on items you have maybe just a couple maybe just one   mayor adler councilmember pool   pool i think that the points that kathie is bringing up are really good ones i had missed the part about early signup people get the full time or more time than others even if they are speaking on something that is going to pass and may not have as much impact   mayor adler we havent done that   pool okay   mayor adler we havent done that when we did the first 20 get three thats when we were calling up people by item   101934 am  number   pool with an item controversial not    mayor adler this predates that the first 20 speakers speak for three minutes and then one minute we did prior to covid and we did it by    pool pro and con   mayor adler by item number   pool right   mayor adler so it was true that the earliest that signed up on that number got the three minutes the later that signed up on that number got the one minute except where there was pretty clearly established sides on the issue in which case sometimes people would come in and say these are the ten speakers that would best be able to lay out the pro case or the con case in which case i varied from the first signup july to say okay these ten people will go first and get the three minutes and the others get one minute   pool yes and i think that may be what you want to get back to    102036 am   tovo thats what our rules say thats exactly it   pool so i think thats important what i really would like to do is resolve it so that we dont spend precious time on the dais during a meeting trying to decide how many minutes people are going to get so i really would like to see that settled before we actually get to a meeting for those reasons so were not spending time arguing about time on the dais   mayor adler and thats why were talking now to try to figure out the rules   pool precisely   mayor adler weve been more dynamically involved in looking at the speakers theyve signed up the things theyve signed up on the numbers of speakers we have and varying it kind of in a meeting management kind of way again trying to keep speakers to an hour to two hours in the morning and hour to two hours in the afternoon never going less than one   102138 am  never going more than three thats how weve been doing it that way as opposed to what we could do is just say you know everybody that signed up on an item the first 20 people or 20 people on each item get three minutes that would significantly increase the amount of speaker time we have both in the morning and in the afternoon if we were to do that and i think thats the choice that is presented   pool i would also like to encourage people to take advantage of emails and other forms of communication i do think in person is the most impactful as opposed to being on a phone line into the meeting because of all the issues that we have with technology even though we have overcome many issues with the technology in the last two and a half to three   102238 am  years but we do still have opportunities to meet and talk with people before meetings we get our emails all of our staff are actively involved in researching and anxiousing peoples  answering peoples questions from constituents by email i would encourage this are many forms of connecting with us and for folks who are taking time out of their day to talk with us we really appreciate and value those inputs and i think all of us want to have multiple open channels for that information to be conveyed to us   mayor adler yes councilmember kelly   kelly thank you ive spent some time talking to constituents in the community and ive heard the very time sends the  varied time sends the wrong impression to the community when they have that opportunity to speak and expectation is not set ahead of time they feel like their   102338 am   time is not valued from us as elected officials and we should be accessible and i know that i had requested some best practices from our cities and how they handle public comment im wondering if you might have that information available is that something that you have feedback about if not thats okay i know the city of san antonio for example i had the opportunity to go to one of their council meetings they have b session and a session b is similar to ours and they allow for public comments on wednesday following b session which allows for more time and the councilmembers are able to speak with speakers if they have followup questions i feel we might be able to solve a lot of time management issues in allowing people the time they should have to speak by allowing an additional opportunity during our council weeks to get that feedback from them so i just wanted to throw that out as an option if it   102438 am  might be the will of the council it might be impactful for the community and make them feel for valued   mayor adler councilmember ellis   ellis i know you and your team do a lot of work before the meetings trying to get the timing right i want to balance the expectation of first of all how late are we going because when we end up going into the late hours of the night maybe were not doing our best work because weve been on the dais for over 12 hours also when people want to follow our debates and deliberations when were voting i know its extremely hard for people to be up  the latest meeting ive been at ended at 418 in the morning and we very quickly who figure out how to balance the need for public input and also be respectful of not working in latemight hours people cant follow our dialogues and wake up and trying to figure out how the night ended   102539 am  its a careful balance trying to manage that time i appreciate that morning block and then the zoning speaker block and kind of having expectation how long those are going to go because we do need to hear from everybody who wants to speak on those items the day that we vote on them or at least in if same meeting i also know our meetings can go 48 hours without having to be reposted these are difficult strategies to make sure everyone feels like their voice is heard and we ask try to do our deliberations in a timely fashion so people know were not going to be voting on things at 400 in the morning   mayor adler councilmember lela   vela i agree and particularry councilmember kellys comments its very difficult to get citizen commentary same day as the council meeting and have that commentary really   102639 am   have any followup or  its honestly its hard to focus on the commentary when were off in kind of working on items and last minute changes and amendments and staff is very busy on those council days i would  i appreciate the example of san antonio i think moving citizen commentary over to for example work session days sometime in the work session that gives us a little more time to i think consider and respond to citizen comments and i think it would open up an opportunity for dialogue on a lot of times i hear some very comments and subject matter there and i would love to follow up with questions but i dont want to do that because i know we have 120 items on the agenda and i dont want to get into a 15minute kind of you know discussion about something so i  i very much agree   102741 am  with councilmember kellys comments about setting aside a specific time where our staff is available where we are available where we can you know respond and engage with the citizens who come and comment i just think doing it in varied points throughout the council meeting i dont see that serving us very well honestly   mayor adler you know we had and try to post on the message board a day in advance kind of what we were doing in terms of the amount of time so that speakers would know when they were coming in we havent been perfect about that and could probably do better to do that all the time to say based on the number of speakers we have in the morning and recommend and this is what we would recommend in terms of speakers that would give speakers an advanced notice of what to   102845 am  perhaps anticipate it gets a little harder now that we have opened up for people to sign up on the day of through the first part of the pandemic we knew the speakers had to sign up a day ahead of time so we knew what the universe of speakers was our policies right now say you have to sign up by 915 is that right which is also a change from prior policy when you could sign up while an item was being debated on that item the policy we have right now is we cut off speakers at 915   915   mayor adler 915 on the day of the signups and you know having additional time for people to speak in front of council is something to be considered and probably tough cycles you know as you go through  we used to have council meetings every week so there was a work   102946 am  session and council meeting every week and we went to that in order to try to avoid having council meetings that went to 900 1000 1100 and thought if we meant more often we would decrease that we had a lot of people that would come to speak we were just there a lot then we had council offices that said theres no time for us to do work because were in meetings all the time so were not having a chance to meet with constituents and the like so all of these things dont have good clear right  answers because everything you do pushes and pulls you know in terms of what happens mayor pro tem   alter thank you i have thoughts to share about first i wanted to ask our clerks office if there were tech things about the system   103046 am  or thoughts you had from your experience that you wanted to share as part of this conversation   sure myrna clerks office just in hearing everyones discussion and recommendations the callin process is very  registration is very labor intensive premeeting and up to the day of so i have three sheets  three pages worth of duties we do  that ive written up and we can distribute that so you can see exactly what it is staff are required to do to prepare for a meeting and then the day of if you choose to take the first 20 speakers say we go back to that route then i would recommend for the callin speakers you take the first ten and then inperson speakers you take ten and then you go from   103146 am  there that would still be very difficult to manage on our end i  weve spoken about this up until today and so our recommendation would be to call the callin speakers first and hearing discussion today those that are registered to speak in person then you can hear them during the items that they registered for like we used to do prepandemic thats an option but we do recommend either way if you can take the speakers first because a lot of them their calls drop or they need to take other phone calls and its very disruptive so although they have the information to call back in they are emailing during the meeting i cant find the number or we have staff asking the vendor to call them back in so on so forth there is a lot going on behind the scenes   103249 am  i dont know if you have anything else to  with regard to the vendor another recommendation we were talking about is utilizing the work session if you know that there is an item thats going to have or bring a lot of speakers then if you can request a time certain of that item that way we can coordinate in advance and ask the vendor to create additional batches and those items will be heard at a different time and those callers will not be called out until a certain time not at the 1000 time slot or 200 rather at 400 or 500 and they wont have to be waiting on the line for you know two hours or two and a half hours a perfect example for thursdays meeting item 59 already has 36 speakers thats the living wage item  or is it 59   103349 am   59 not 56 its the living wage items and registration closes tomorrow at noon so we anticipate getting more this would be an item that we would recommend you state that you would  someone state that on thursday a time certain will be requested and therefore we know that will tip us off and request the vendor to create an additional batch for us   alter thank you   mayor adler hold on mayor pro tem   alter i had other comments but as long as you will come back to me   mayor adler well come back to you comments on staff councilmember tovo   tovo so that  and i hadnt had  i had forgotten to mention time certains but that to me avoids the issues where well hear three minutes from living wage and everybody else speaking about anything else on the agenda is going to be truncated to one minute because thats such a popular item if we move that to its own   103451 am  area then it doesnt impact  if for some reason were not willing to go back to what the rules state the living wage the first batch would be three minutes and then they would all have one minute and the other agenda items would proceed the way they always do then i think we should move it to its own area as we used to with the time certains so thanks for that suggestion   mayor adler given my druthers my preference would be do it in the morning if you set a time certain during the day you never know if thats going to work even though we had a time certain it created an expectation we would stop we dont stop because we cant when we get there and it makes it harder to pull things up over the course of the day to be strategic about filling gaps and filling times which is one of the reasons why weve been able to get out before   103553 am  dinner as often as we have because weve been really strategic in what we call but hearing now what you say we have been calling the ones in the room first for covid reasons but i would be very comfortable given what you just said to say lets hear from people on the phone first if we had a big item when people were calling i would be happy to call that item first my recommendation would be absent a specific decision on something otherwise that we would still keep the  you know the timing we have you know 46 speakers or 36 speakers on that thats not the inperson speakers were going to have a lot of inperson speakers we could be in the situation where we have 100 speakers in the morning and at three minutes thats 300 minutes thats five hours world war   103654 am  ii of speakers  worth of experts if you are going to give people three minutes on every topic if you are going to give three minutes on that one thats an hour then you have an hour and a half after that so  if you had the same number of speakers it would be two and a half hours of speakers in the morning remember we start at ten so if we go from ten to  1000 to noon the question is do we take then the public speakers at noon and then go to lunch and come back to finish the speakers we have in the morning what ive been trying to do is to get it so that we have all the speakers done in the morning so we dont have speakers that are having to hold and come back after  after lunch you know trying to  and adjusting the times to help ensure that we have  if we dont do anything else we try to get  hear all the morning speakers in the morning so again you know you pull   103755 am  a thread here or pull something else over there and its trying to find  but i would be really comfortable from a blocking and hearing everybody all together when we have something like that taking the phone call speakers first and if theres an important item hearing those speakers first then hearing the rest of the phone calls and then coming in the room hearing on that big item first and then the balance of speakers councilmember kelly and then well come back were still on this topic   kelly i just wanted to say i like the idea of allowing the opportunity for more flexibility so we can have more breathing room on council days to get the work done and follow up with speakers we have a lot of great people in the city of austin who are involved in our processes and i want them to feel like their time is valued and that we are actually taking consideration to what they are saying im not suggesting we arent just taking speakers the day of could give the   103856 am  impression we are not considering that what voting i really appreciate the discussion and feedback thank you   mayor adler okay anything else mayor pro tem   alter thank you so id like to know from our legal department whether were even allowed to do it on a separate day its my understanding that with the changes that the legislature made for councils i dont think they made it for themselves we are required to allow anyone to have an opportunity on any item for someone to speak if its on our agenda im not sure if we did it the day before it would actually reduce any amount of time it might provide another opportunity to hear from folk but i think well just hear from folks multiple times   right im not suggesting we would not have public comment on the day of the vote just to have thecoma opportunity to maybe  the extra opportunity but im interested to hear from legal too   thank you   103956 am   the state legislature has required people are able to speak on the day you are taking a vote on the item but if its an extra opportunity not taking away the opportunity from the day of the vote then you certainly can do that   kelly thank you   alter thank you when i think about what sets austin apart is our community engagement we have a higher level of community engagement than most our cities by far and thats a good thing but its you know what were trying to manage with this process i would be curious if weve looked at all at what the countys system is and what they are use to go sign up if thats any more flexible or are they not getting the amount of speakers you are   you are correct they are not receiving the same amount of speakers that we are   alter okay i  i want to just express that i think that we    104101 am  particularly for zoning we really need to be hearing the speakers when were taking up the items it lends a lot more coherence allows us to focus on the particular issues so i would really like to see us move to that system on zoning going back to where we were you know issue like item by item especially our discussion items for that i think that also you know there will be a tradeoff that were going to  we will observe you know with this process we will be here much later i do not believe that we make good decisions when they are debating after 1000 and i dont know what the solution is for that because we regularly when we do go behalf 1000 we push on to try to get done i do not believe that leads   104202 am  to good decisions or a good process for that in terms of when you start taking the callins before those in person we are at a medium level of covid and im not sure that to tomorrow is the day or thursday is the day to switch that around when we have a higher level of risk in the community   mayor adler councilmember renteria   renteria you know to me i dont have a problem staying up late you know thats not my problem you know i dont have that kind of problem so you know im willing to stay up as late as anybody wants to stay here in the mornings i never complain about that my biggest concern is when we start doing zoning that we delay some of these zoning issues till after 1000 and now we have people that have been there since 200   104306 am  now are there and its after 1000 and ive seen some people just walk out because they just have  they have a life and you know theyve families and they work but to me i really dont  it doesnt bother me either way you know weve gone through this cycle every time theres a new  councilmembers get elected we go through this cycle again and were probably going to be repeating this thing once were gone im gone they are still going to have that  still a conversation about how to conduct the meetings so i wish that someone  weve got all these really smart people in austin to come up and maybe recommend a solution of what they would like to see and id be willing to accept whatever the outcome is   104407 am   mayor adler okay if you have pages that  i would suggest why dont you hand that out so we have that as background information   sure but so that i understand correctly on thursday we will continue as we have when we return in july then we will take callin speakers first then inperson speakers it has not been decided yet whether or not you would  will call time certain items so that we can create a separate batch for these contentious items   mayor adler well have a time certain but call it for either the more than or afternoon so people know rather than have an item time because we dont know what time that would be help me understand is there a logistic  if we wanted to in zoning cases have   104507 am  people testify at the case can you do that both remotely and in person or does that really only work for inperson people   for in person we would have to depending on the number of items and the number of speakers registered for callin we would have to create multiple batches and i dont know how that would work i would have to speak with the vendor i know weve done up to five maybe but this  this seems like it would call for many more and so we would likely need to pull another one of our staff members to help us you know manage that process on that  on our end the day of the meeting   mayor adler so we could when we came back if people wanted to on zoning cases take the morning block give people the opportunity to speak in the morning both on the phone or in person if someone on a zoning case decides they want to speak   104607 am  at the case itself they could be here in person but not speak at the afternoon call time and they could stay there when the case got up they could testify and what we would tell them is somewhere over the next eight hours well call the case   and thats where we get a lot of pushback and mean emails   mayor adler those would only be people in person   okay    mayor adler and i know we get pushback from that so a question for  i always feel badly when i know theres a person sitting there for a zoning case and its seven hours before the zoning case gets called but that happens sometimes if we have a lot of staff that are waiting for something to get brought up or we have consultants that are coming in or we need something to be considered before something else gets considered or just from a time   104708 am  management standpoint i recognize the benefit of having people have the opportunity to speak when their case gets called but  but it also creates lots of  lots of issues and inefficiencys and well extend the time of our meeting and its difficult you cant have a 1000 cutoff and the desire to open up speaking because one of those has to give for the other win  the other one   tovo maybe thats the compromise there is a clear cutoff unless one whole group of people show up that they didnt realize this case is on the agenda for most of the people its a 10 cutoff because that i think preserves the most   104808 am  ability for the public to engage because the other choices are just more challenging and you know sometimes frankly i think we  it does add time if you have people from another  the mixup of zoning folks and other issues adds time because were saying what case are you talking about when somebody else covered it an hour early in their testimony i think theres a real efficiency when you have folks  they are building ideas on each other rather than just repeating them to me that would be a compromise   mayor adler so right now    tovo also i think continuing to be the kind of work more challenging with the hybrid issues but in the morning say it sounds like were not going to get to this item until this time so that  and really prioritizing trying to hit some of those issues before the lynch lunch  lunch   104912 am  before staff can go last week i said comments on that real estate item we took it up almost one of the last things of the day and michael gates from real estate stayed that whole day i mean if i had known that he really was going to stay i would have said ill make my comments after it passes we need to prioritize staffs time as well and try to hit those things that are pulling our staff out for a entire day as well   mayor adler i try to do a better job of posting ahead of the meeting the number of speakers we have in each block and how i would be recommending approach that    tovo we can tack  talk about it today the big items appear to be c x and z living wage is one of those maybe my colleagues have zoning cases in their districts that are going to be  draw a lot of speakers statesman would have been one if collectively we could   105014 am  spend ten minutes these are the big items by tuesday we have a pretty good against what some of those are going to be   mayor adler in the morning block in person or well take that item up those speakers will speak first yes mayor pro tem   alter thank you i also wanted to just suggest that we should allow for councilmembers to make their comments right after we vote on consent folks dont really  its hard for people to follow what we voted on consent and disjointed when it happens ten hours later we can ask people to be short and brief and keep that in mind which we should always do but we should try to keep those comments together with the consent agenda   id like to agree with mayor pro tem because you know i often find myself voting no on certain items on the consent agenda and it creates more peek for me in my office because reporters   105115 am  peach out and want to know why i voted no and i just want that opportunity to provide that to the public and the media   mayor adler ill go ahead  last week was the first time we did it that way we did it that way because we were close to 100 but we definitely could have done the comments at that point and just  you know and it will extend to whenever it extends to but ill do that all right it is 10 to 1100 we want to go into session executive session now   councilmember renteria acknowledged this happens a lot but one of the things we try to do is ask our staff people you know if we are having a late night if its going to look like its going to go long or the things not time certain you can pull off i would really ask that you think about that with the items from council there are a lot of items from council and some of the   105216 am  ones most exciting and draw a lot of folks if its something that you know as we do the consent agenda and we can do that at our next meeting decide that early in the day so that we can plan so we can really try and not go past 1000 i appreciate that you stay up late councilmember renteria but after we had that 400 in the morning meeting you all committed as council we would not do that our staff to our citizens to residents that thats not a wise way to do business so thank you were fine to go into executive session    mayor adler if council did an analysis before on timing and weve made pretty significant changes can you do in your spare time   laughter   update that review of when council meetings have been ending over the last couple years relative to when they were ending prior to that point   sure we can do that   mayor adler that i   105316 am  think would be a way to evaluate how weve gone doing things   sure so what we will also do is compile all the recommendations and provide you  we can provide you with options that may work for all if not you can continue the discussion and just to piggyback on annes comment for us if the zoning items if we can be made aware of what items will be postponed we understand that jerrys guesses are a draft but we know there are conversations being had throughout the meeting with staff and the applicants or developers and whatnot so if we can be told in advance that would save so much time on our end if we can just communicate keep that communication line open that would be great we would appreciate it   mayor adler okay great   inaudible   mayor adler councilmember renteria   renteria im just   105416 am  wondering also you know sometimes we know that there has been discussion about postponement but we dont make that decision until we get on the dais im going to try to make sure that i get that information before noon so that i can relay it to    mayor adler that would be helpful if you can post those to the message board since we cant make decisions outside the council meeting people could express agreement or reservations on the message board that would be helpful i think for the public to be able to anticipate as well mayor pro tem   alter thank you i just wanted to flag a couple things on a couple items i believe its number 62 which is extension of the economic prosperity commission rather than taking time on our thursday meeting just want to flag that in audit and finance we discussed the need for us to   105516 am   take a look at our commissions and boards and make sure that they are serving the needs of the council the request was made for that first to be a council discussion and then we can determine if we need to what end okay of public comment et cetera we might need to have looking forward to doing that in late summer or early fall if folks can think about the board and commissions that you find useful or think about ones you feel like they are not hearing from they are not adding to your work so we can think about how we are best utilizing the talent in our community as well as our staff you know for which boards and commissions we might want to take a look at more carefully to see whether we want to continue them or if we want to put a sunset clause on those commissions we dont yet have a process for doing this but i wanted   105617 am  to flag that and i dont think we have to have that conversation on the dais on thursday i can just make the motion for extending the economic prosperity commission some of us are working on amendments to item 50 thank you   mayor adler but item 62 about the existence and operations of the economic prosperity commission should still move forward   alter yes but the calf yet in audit and finance we want a broader conversation that commission happened to be the vehicle that sparked the conversation its not necessarily aimed at that commission because this is a second or third extension weve had to make for our commission in the last several months s so the code requires if the commission hasnt met quorum for a certain number of   105719 am  times they have to go to audit and finance committee and we have to make a determination as to whether they should continue the commission or not weve been seeing more of those and in seeing more of those we realize its been ten years since we looked at the commissions so it would be a good time to look at that   mayor im sorry if somebody else is first   mayor adler councilmember ellis   ellis which item   alter 50   kelly will those    ellis will those be on the message board   mayor adler which number 50 in the living wage issue   kitchen two questions the first question were you talking in terms of looking at all of the commissions and if thats the case i think that we should learn from the previous effort that was done which involved    105820 am  the public in a conversation about the commissions that was done in preparation for the change in council to a  you know    mayor adler 101   kitchen yeah the 101 sorry thank you it was done in conjunction with 101 it was a public input process that was rather extensive that i think it was important so i think its timely to look at the commissions but i dont think the council should do it without some process that involves the public so i would just recommend that and then with regard to item 50 on behalf of councilmember fuentes she asked me to let her know if there was any discussion about item 50 can you give us an idea of  im sorry when did you say you would be posting amendments i think it would be really important to see those at least by tomorrow   105923 am   alter we will have them ready as soon as we can we have meetings all day so we have to coordinate and well do the best we can   kitchen can you commit to having them ready before thursday so councilmember fuentes has the opportunity to look at them before thursday   alter i think that would be the intention   kitchen pardon   alter that would be the intention   kitchen great thank you very much   mayor adler councilmember tovo just a couple things from my perspective on this agenda things lime looking at number 4 is the fashion incubator let me say about the commission on commissions councilmember kitchen one thing we talked about in audit and finance we have such limited resources now and staff time is also a taxpayer resource so i suggested it might be helpful if we had a conversation first at the council level about which commissions  which   110025 am  commissions we were finding most useful and which using their recommendations i agree the public should have input into it and feedback and we would want to consult the commissions and those stakeholders who support any commission but rather than having a commission on commissions what happened last time they came to down and council said we find this valuable are there commissions that you  where they make recommendations that we  where they dont make recommendations but they serving a different role and we have a conversation among council first about which are the most useful they are all useful in one way or another but i think were going to have to make choices in my opinion i think were going to have to make hard choices about when we are putting dollars and staff time because we have such limited bits of both that brings knee to number 4     110130 am   kitchen could i respond gift box   mayor adler its not on our agenda but we need to tee it up   kitchen maybe its a message board conversation since those of us who werent in audit and finance would like to weigh in that would be great   mayor adler okay   alter we wanted to start with an initial conversation i dont have a plan for the process other than whether we have the conversation at audit and finance there was request for us to have a deeper conversation at council which i would assume would include a broader discussion on the process i was just simply    mayor adler lets  were talking about how were going to approach it and we cant do that so the public can participate in this process if they want to councilmember tovo you had   110231 am  something else   tovo again im trying to be thoughtful about as we move into the budget and asking departments what  what work they are doing that has been useful and interesting and was worth investing in but we might need to make a different choice for some of the new and emerging priorities the continued funding on fashion incubator is one im looking closely at we had a conversation about this a vigorous conversation the last two times it came through it was initiative of a councilmember a long time ago ifc that was  i think we need to just  well anyway im looking at that to see what kind of results are coming from that and whether it needs to be reinvest understand a different kind of program 90 is councilmember harpermadisons item regarding telecommunications facilities i read through it quickly i do have questions i   110332 am  didnt pull it but air what some of the questions are im going to work to get answers to between here and thursday i am always going to be a supporter of doing things to help out our school districts and appreciate your leadership in bringing this forward i had a cell tower i have to go back and think through and research the conversation but i believe if im remembering correctly i had a cell tower next to an elementary school in thigh district where there was a pretty active advocacy on the part of neighbors and parents to remove that from that area it was unsuccessful because they were kemped concerned about the impact on student health one i want to remind myself if im remembering those details correctly but i would be interesting if youve got additional information that you can offer about whether that is something we might encounter if there are cell towers on those properties that would be really helpful    110432 am  to know i want to make sure were expanding digital access to students in the district and this could very well be the best way to do it so i just wanted to air that as something im thinking about 87 i am still reviewing im supportive of it absolutely and a cosponsor i am interested in raising this to the attention of the city manager councilmember alter had broad forward a resolution about  it was during the pandemic and i thought we had kind of agreed we were going to work from some of the data the county was producing about teleworking but im kind of interested this just raised my memory that im still awaiting kind of the answers to all of those questions that you prompted in your resolution   alter thank you   110533 am  so councilmember renteria brought forward this resolution which does build on other work that ive worked on and im a cosponsor and i believe that we added  i have to look at the final draft but i believe that we added in there looking at the countys program for telecommuting we put reference in there to the 2020 resolution where we asked the city manager to look at telecommuting and patterns and opportunity to save money from making those steps and we also made reference to our facilities planning process where we have plans in place were going to save us a lot of money but now with telecommuter we should revise and it will save more money with office hotels which is what councilmember renteria is calling for and so you know we had been   110634 am  talking about doing a separate resolution but he had already kind of drafted it so we just folded what we were doing into it as well   tovo it seemed the two efforts were very much aligned ill have to look closely at what information weve gotten back my question is really about what information we got back in response to your resolution i think were still kind of waiting for it is my feeling about it i appreciate your leadership  councilmember renteria ive been speaking with both of you so im glad to see it moving forward but i personally had hoped we would have some of that information by now   alter i think you are correct that we havent heard a lot back i think that was a function of covid lasting a lot longer than we anticipated at the time that we drafted we had this in the resolution where we established inaudible   110734 am   conservation corps because we were looking at environmental issues that were raised buoy  raised by the pandemic in may of 2020 and that was a function of the telecommuting and the other stuff all lasting a lot longer than we anticipated and it was premature for a long while   mayor adler rodney did you want to say something   if there are responses to the previous resolution we will resend those to the whole of council if there are no responses councilmember tovo well letter office no there are no responses   tovo thank you very much   mayor adler that closes the loop for everybody mayor pro tem   alter if i could just add one of the things that i dont know if it was distributed to all of council but in my conversations with city staff there was kind of one size does not fit all approach to telecommuting and so that was another   110836 am  obstacle at the time and there was some sharing i think over time with how different departments were handling things but not necessarily the fuller look at how we might be able to leverage what weve already initiated due to the pandemic and move forward with in the future to save money and to provide better working conditions   mayor adler okay thank you colleagues i have discussed i appreciate councilmember kellys leadership on isc with respect to the license plate reader i appreciate your leadership on that ive spoken and will be posting something on the message board having an item come up just before we do the budget and needs to be appropriately part of that something i will support in the budget process i also want to make sure it   110938 am  contains some of the protections and guide answers and will be posting about some of the models that have been created for  in other places by some of the advocates on how to handle and deal with those and will be posting that   alter i really appreciate that feedback and i will take a look at the information you provide on the message board to see how it alliance with some of the protections i placed in that ifc im particularly proud of the research i did and the work our legal department did to help ensure that some of the i guess misconceptions and misinformation out in the community about the utilization of this technology by our police department can be used in a way that is just and right for our entire community and so i appreciate your note about the budget also just now we did tie the ifc into ensuring the city manager places it in the budget so it is part of the budget process i feel bringing it forward as a resolution is impactful   111040 am   for the overall morale of the police department and officers so they are aware we are working towards giving them the tools they really do need to be able to keep our community safe i appreciate that   mayor adler thank you councilmember tovo   tovo im a cosponsor of this item and i did a resolution now ive done two resolutions this meeting and last meeting that are also looking toward the budget and we do a lot of great work during the budget and a lot of really fun things and important things have come out of the budget direction i think for example the hotel occupancy tax the first switch to really investing in historic preservation came forward as not an ifc but a budget direction i think in our budget in our budget direction and in our budget amendments we can do important policy work too but there are some issues like this one and like the one i brought last week the rainey historic district fund that might require a little bit of conversation and to me its helpful if we   111140 am  have that conversation prior to the budget so i support councilmember kelly in the effort and also in having that conversation now where we have not a lot of time but a little bit more time in the budget process on the policy implications and to address some of the concerns like the ones youre referencing that makes sense to me as an ifc heading into the budget just because theyre complicated issues   mayor adler and i want to have the conversation by offering an amendment that has the resolution not telling them to put it into the budget but ask him to consider putting it into the budget because when we get the budget well be deciding between many different competing priorities and i dont want to prejudge just from an institutional way i dont want to prejudge priorities before all the priorities are in front of us i think thats the most appropriate time to handle that but we can decide that question anything else on this    kitchen yes mayor i had my hand up   111241 am   mayor adler councilmember kitchen   kitchen im a cosponsor on this item also and thank you to councilmember kelly for bringing it forward mayor we put some language in the resolution at this point i worked with councilmember kelly to make sure we had some language in protecting against the concerns people had raised you may have additional things that you want to look at so that would be  i cant speak for councilmember kelly but for my perspective that would be welcome we did a number of things including referencing the police oversight office as playing a role as well as some other things that are in it now i invite you to look at whats in it and councilmember kelly felt it was important to include those things so the i invite you to look at whats in it right now and you may have some additional things do know that effort was made to address the concerns that people have raised   111341 am    mayor adler all right i saw that and i appreciated that work we can augment it to really reassure people because i know how big an issue it was because as a council we basically stopped this practice on these issues so i want to make sure its really clear and there are really strong protections in addition to the great work thats already been done anything else before we go to executive session natasha councilmember harpermadison   harpermadison thank you mayor i appreciate it actually it was  im going to go backwards a little bit i didnt realize we were jumping off of the topics when we were discussing specifically councilmember tovo brought up item number 90 and item number 87 this is is neither of the two but along the conversation around things that we might highlight on thursday id like to present to the body that ive been receiving some inquiries from folks about expanding   111442 am  our work from home options for city employees specifically in this inquiry it was about 911 dispatchers who are unfortunately by way of the lack of affordability in the city of austin a lot of those folks dont live anywhere near where they have to go in order to do their job as our dispatchers and the current level of fuel cost is creating a massive financial burden and hardship for some of our 911 call takers so that was brought to me specifically and adamantly by one of our constituents who personally is not affected but is watching her colleagues be affected so i just wanted to highlight that item for something for us to kind of put on the table to discuss as a body and figure out what what if anything we can do in order to help relieve some of that burden that cost burden on some of our employees who really just frankly cant afford to do anything but telecommute and that was all thank you   mayor adler thank you   111543 am  councilmember kelly   kelly quickly id just like to raise a potential option for having mr rusthoven present to us before we break for executive session since hes still here i believe he has another briefing for us   mayor adler we could certainly do i dont know who we have waiting for us in executive session   we have three executive sessions and we can do them when youre ready   mayor adler lets stick with the plan we announced because people may have based their timing more broadly on that and we can come back and do it city council will go now go into closed session to take up four items pursuant to 551072 matters related to st johns and pursuant to 551 roadway 0d city of austin we will have items e2 3 and 4 which is the women owned   111646 am  enterprise procurement fund and st johns and health care we will go into executive session here at 1116 well come out after executive session for the briefings i think thats all we have left   executive session   22415 pm   mayor adler you set okay were out of closed session n closed session we discussed real estate matters related to item e2 and we discussed legal issues related to items e2 and e4 it wasnt necessary to discuss legal issues related to item e3 but it is now 224 we are back we have two briefings which will close you our day first the pud on south lamar and then the climate equity plan if youre ready    yes we are   mayor adler lets go ahead and start with the planned unit development   thank you mayor and with us today we have contingent director jerry rusthoven from the housing and planning development  housing and planning department   thank you rodney   22516 pm  again jerry rusthoven im here today to present this item the case is cd2022 o1 this is a briefing on a proposed planned unit development or pud located at 517 south lamar boulevard just a quick reminder to the council the citys land development code requires that prior to submitting a pud application the developer is required to do what we call a developer assessment a dry run of what they were proposing to submit in the future we offer comments from the city staff for numerous city departments on that and give them back to the applicant and we give a briefing to the council on the  some of the overall big picture and whats going to be submitted in the future for the pud this pud is located at 5 sin south lamar were calling it the bike pud its the location of the bike shop as well as the mcdonalds at the southeast corner of barton springs and south lamar it is approximately two acre property currently zoned csv applicant again is proposing   22617 pm  pud or planned unit development zoning the proposed project is a 400 unit residential project with 10000 square feet of either retail or restaurant on the first floor the applicant is proposing a pud as proposed to using the existing zoning because theyre proposing to go up to 102 feet in height which the existing zoning does not allow nor does the vmu overlay even with the proposed vmu 2 it would still be slightly taller than that with regard to relax of commercial design standards those are the two major requests along with a waiver of compatibility standards and ill get to that in a moment in exchange the superiority the applicant is offering are affordability at the level of 10 at 60 mfi for the entirety of the project 95of the parking being provided underground   22719 pm   a reduction in impervious cover from whats on the ground today or what is allowed by todays code the varying burying of overhead utility lanes on lamar boulevard green water building controls better landscaping than today which would be anything rainwater irrigation three star green building and improved bicycle and pedestrian facilities again the major ask is for the height and with the height request would be a waiver of compatibility i would like to point out that its important to note that the compatibility on this site is being triggered on the one hand by the former he will lodge other in the bouldin neighborhood on the other side of the railroad tracks from this property and is zoned singlefamily as many lodges are but we do not feel as we discussed last thursday i think this came up with regard to civic uses and compatibility there is no need to protect the he will lodge from height it actually is quite a ways away the other thing triggering compatibility are the homes that are on the cliff above   22821 pm  the car west at the singlefamily corner of barton springs and south lamar it is important to note that the cliffs are so high that the homes would still be above the height of the proposed building even at 102 feet so again we dont see a need necessarily to protect the homes from height when the homes are in fact higher than the building that were talking about being built so im going to keep my presentation pretty simple im available for any questions once this briefing is complete the applicant may submit the actual pud application we go through the usual process reviewed by multiple city departments input from the city staff review by the minimum environmental board planning commission and then finally back to the city council   kitchen mayor   mayor adler councilmember kitchen   kitchen yes so let me say first this is in my district south lamar and yes i dont think compatibility is an issue at all just what we passed the   22923 pm  resolution makes that clear because whats triggering compatibility is like you said its up on a cliff and its also the other side of lamar which i think what we passed in item 66 said that we werent going to count compatibility across the major streets so i dont think compatibility is an issue and i know were not quite there yet because we still have to pass an actual ordinance but once we  assuming we continue with what we passed last week they wont need any kind of pud to reduce compatibility the height they are asking for more than 90 feet so i guess they would need a pud for that i do want to point out that 10 at 66  60 mfi is below the staffs recommendation that the council adopted last week the council adopted 10 but that was at 50 mfi and 12 at 60 mfi at 90 feet   23025 pm   so im going to  if this continues and thats by right so they could do that by right so im going to have a question about providing them more height at less affordability than we passed last week based on staff recommendation let me ask another question about  did you say something about burying the lines   sure today there is phone poles along lamar and they would be buried underground in front of this project   kitchen so tell me more about that what the lines are right in front of the property or along south lamar   in front of the property   kitchen can they do that i mean i would like to hear from austin energy because basically you would have lines  i dont remember where the poles are but you would have poles and poles and bury for just that front   23125 pm  age and go back up   a good example at across the river   kitchen is that how its done   they take the lines and bury them   kitchen where is that   at the stream building directly across the river from here   kitchen i didnt realize they could do that its great okay then what was the other  for a pud whats the other value extra    lets see they are proposing the affordability 90 of parking underground impervious cover is 97 98 they would take it down to 90 lets see burying the lines improve the drainage conditions there is a small amount of floodplain on this property that wraps actually from the one side of the railroad tracks wraps around the intersection there so they would improve the drainage   23226 pm  positions utilize green water quality controls improve landscaping which as i said theres none today and bicycle parking   kitchen bicycle parking is that on a floodplain its not  the floodplain doesnt extend to that   it does its mostly on the east side of the tracks but that goes under the viaduct and comes around its pretty significant on the peter pan side but heres theres just a tail that reaches in what they are proposing is there will actually be a couple columns for the building but underneath the columns would be  that would not have any structure in it   kitchen do they have to get a waiver    that would be part of the pud process   kitchen remind me whats being proposed in terms of number of units   right now 400   23327 pm   kitchen 400 units okay great   10000 square feet of restaurant or retail on the first floor   kitchen what was the other part   10000 square feet of restaurant or retail on the first floor   kitchen thank you let me just say to my colleagues i think this is a good location for this kind of  this kind of development it makes a lot of sense on that location my only question is the level of affordability since its already zoned b i dont want to pass what we just passed and then immediately not use it so im going to have to be satisfied immediately not use it for a taller building   i understand the discussion you had last thursday but currently in the code even under the existing pud provisions this is going above and beyond the existing conditions just as a heads   23430 pm  up because they are doing the entire building as opposed to bonus area it is more than what you passed but is more than what its todays code   kitchen but its zoned vmu now   correct   kitchen so it isnt existing and i wouldnt consider    this is more than today  i mean its more than what the pud ordinance if they asked for a pud would require today but you are right it has csv zoning today and under what you passed last week it would require more affordability than what they are proposing right now   kitchen but a comparison for a pud is not based on the pud requirements its based on what they could do today and so i would not consider it  i would not consider it an extra benefit to comply or not even to comply with their current zoning on affordability so i dont see how that  i   23530 pm  dont see how you can see a pud doesnt require affordability but their base zoning does how can we say that they are getting  because the pud requires some extra benefits i can see all the other things we mentioned as extra benefits    agreed councilmember under the code that exists today not what was proposed on thursday which would be future    kitchen no we passed a code amendment on thursday   we will work on them with trying to get the affordability up it is true on this building were talking about the entire structure and a pud would normally talk about the bonus area but i understand your point   kitchen im just saying for purposes of the you know the criteria for pud you know what our responsibility is as a council is to work with the developer on  i forget whether or not  what the term is   subpoena    23657 pm  subperioh i imagine they will be filing pretty soon usually a pud takes minimum the better part of a year well say   more about bike and pedestrian infrastructure this particular section of lamar was i believe part of the 2016 corridor bike lanes and those got slightly held up because there may be some other issues trying to be worked out but would absolutely love to make sure that conversation is happening so we dont miss an opportunity away from the hike and bike trail to have people walking and biking to it so they dont have to drive to the trail and i know this isnt part of zoning but do you have any information about future tenants just in case people watching are wondering if this would be part of a bike shop or clinic im sure people are wondering what else is going on the ground floor   weve not had those   23758 pm  discussions yet theres no guarantee but we can talk to the applicants to see if they have any idea at this point   ellis we love the bicycle sport shop and are happy to see what next phases take it to but make sure were not losing one of our our bike shops i would hate to lose that type of infrastructure in this location i know thats not part of zoning that happens later in the conversation   mayor adler okay councilmember vella   vela why the 200 feet and im trying to understand some of the decisions that developers are making and why they are making them if youve got the 90 feet potentially by right on the bmu2 and that just passed but why go 102 as opposed to   23858 pm   90 do you understand what the thinking is   councilmember i think you are right they did submit this prior to the code amendment that passed last thursday i honestly dont know why they are asking for 102 feet i presume theyve asked an architect design the building and thats probably what it comes out to   vela thank you   mayor adler kathie   tovo yeah a couple quick questions this is actually under the new maps going to be district 9 or is district 9 im not sure when it  when we start saying its in one district or another and jerry i think i understood what you are saying about that the only residential singlefamily residential to be captured was across lamar but i think dawson would be too though probably under the new changes that were initiated they wouldnt be but can you speak to where   24002 pm  the singlefamily homes along dawson fall within  do they fall within  do they trigger come pattability   they do not but the old elks lodge does   tovo but the elks lodge has singlefamily south of it thats why i was asking about those residences it looked quickly from the map as if they were within the compatibility radius   the zoning and the structure the use that triggered it now was both the residential the cliff by the car wash as well as  i cant remember the new name of the elks lodge   tovo the high line    its high something   tovo im drawing a blank on it too and what is the baseline  what is the current zoning and what is the baseline   current zoning is csv   24103 pm  prior to last wednesday would be 60 feet but then we have what happened last thursday so  but anyway the baseline is 60 thats whats currently allowed without using a density bonus program   tovo so the baseline prior to last week would have been 60    sorry councilmember it would still be 60 the baseline as of last thursday we have a bonus program v which it already has but we can go above 60   tovo but for the purposes of the pud and determining what the baseline is its the zoning it has it doesnt count what it might be able to access and they are proposing 102   thats correct    tovo so for the purposes of calculating affordable housing it would be 42 feet   correct   tovo okay great thank you   24204 pm   mayor adler anything else on this before we move on yes   just one last thought i wanted to be mindful of green space you said i believe this is fully impervious cover or close to it at this point so i would love to figure how we calibrate that conversation around hopefully getting some more green space involved in it because theres always that tugofwar with impervious cover height and green space just would love to have this better blended into  its right near councilmember kitchens eco climate district so i want to be mindful of taking opportunities to not have as much impervious cover   well work on both the impervious cover and open space at the same time   thank you   mayor adler anything else jerry thank you   sure   mayor adler that gets us to our last briefing   and the city manager is going to introduce this   24306 pm  presentation   thank you mayor council this is our last presentation today and we want to just acknowledge and appreciate the opportunity to brief you on this climate equity plan this afternoon lucia and leading our citys efforts since its adoption last fall today is simply an opportunity to update you on the work in progress thats been made to this point about out we know and acknowledge this critical work is ongoing and theres so much to be done we are pleased to share this update and look forward to future opportunities to provide future updates ill hand it over to our chief sustainability officer   thank you spencer and good afternoon mayor mayor pro tem council city manager and assistant city managers were delighted to share this update and i wanted to  my name   24409 pm  is lucia zoned by zach bomber in the office of sustain biological i just wanted to quickly set the stage for the presentation you are about to hear asbestos a reminder i wanted to  this is an updated plan from the original plan in 2015 that plan had a goal of note zero by 2050 this plan was adopted way council  in september of last year we have been making progress on implementing the plan theres of course still much more to be done but i do want to reassure you that as soon as the plan was adopted staff got to work rolling up their sleeves trying to figure out how to implement the new plan and that work continues this updated version of the plan just real quickly took on a new very intensive focus on equity issues and adjust transition and it also included a fully vetted land acknowledgment statement in the plan hundreds of hours of community stakeholder work went into this plan along   24510 pm  with hundreds of hours of staff time from staff from around a dozen departments and this plan really was truly a committee creation between the community  cocreation between community and staff i want to thank all the community members who might be listening in and staff for all their hard work and departmental support i wanted to quickly note the plan does address multiple council directives including a resolution asking for a transportation electrification plan which was folded into the umbrella of this plan in a special situation on transportation electric if i indication also a council resolution about natural gas emissions reduction the declaration of a climate emergency and also the adoption by council of a more aggressive carbon neutral goal to get us to net zero by 2040 todays presentation is going to give you a high level overview today plus some highlights of activities that the office   24610 pm  of sustainability is directly leading but as i think you are all aware this is a multidepartment plan what were planning to do is come back with subsequent updates that will drill into more specific areas of the plan and other departments that is being carried out to implement the recommendations in the plan so i think we can go to the next slide our team was excited to hear about discussions that mayor and council held back in february identifying climate change and resilience as one of the top priority indicators obviously theres a shared acknowledgment of the criticalness of the work being done todays presentation includes a status update kind of a snapshot of goals and strategies in the plan but its also going to address several things that were requested via 2021 council resolution some of those were also address understand a memo to mayor and council which you should have received on   24711 pm  friday some of those things include new funding and resources for implementation of the plan the creation of a strategy tracking dashboard and also the extension of the community climate ambassadors program which we are re very proud of next slide then also just very quickly and i wont go over all of these but just wanted to acknowledge austins real leadership role in this space n the country and around the globe were one of four cities including denver san francisco that have adopted that very aggressive goal along with many other international cities and then also highlighting the last bullet just to note that progress is being made communitywide emissions decreased by 25 over a tenyear period the per capita emissions decreased 39 so more to be done but i think were    24813 pm  making good progress as dire as our  all the climate news we hear is i always like to at least touch on the fact there is good progress being made next slide   hi im zach balmer just to remind everybody of communitywide carbon footprint and why emissions are coming from this our community that cause climate change there are these five sectors each one of these chunks is essentially the tenyear trend for each of these areas the two largest sectors are energy and buildings which is made up of electricity usage and natural gas usage and buildings those emissions have been dropping precipitously over the last decade because of action taken guy austin energy and our community with solar and renewable energy second largest is transportation as you can see those emissions dropped dramatically from 2019 to 2020 because of the pandemic   24913 pm  and the reduction in vehicle usage in 2020 we expect those emissions to tick back up some but thats where we are in 2020 the three other sectors of emissions are pretty small industrial emissions semiconductor facilities and refrigerants and waste emissions when you stack all these up all these bars on top of each other that equals that 25 in communitywide reductions over the last ten years so just very quickly these next few slides to remind everyone what is in the climate equity plan this was adopted by city council last fall at the highest level there are 17 quantitative goals which are community focused outcome goals were aiming at 2030 to be achieved then are 74 strategies in the plan which are all of the work to be done which are spread across five sections and really focused on the next five years this plan the first version   25015 pm  was adopted in 2015 this plan adopted in 2021 so every five years were essentially planning to do an update on this also really important to remember the climate equity plan fits in the context of all of these other plans and all this work being done across the city organization austin energys work austin water resource and recovery and more all of their activities feed into and connect and support the whole which sort of becomes the full city response to climate change next slide there were four overarching strategies passed along  as part of the sort of guidance of this plan they are green jobs and entrepreneurship prioritize ing locally  regional collaboration and carbon offsets and carbon dioxide were as the office of sustain built are trying to   25117 pm  keep an eye on these big picture directives as we see implementation move forward next slide finally there are five goal areas in this plan that make up what is the plan so the first section is consumption of food and goods and products section is sustainable buildings natural systems transportation land use  and the fifth transportation electrification its important to note two sections focused on transportation is key because transportation is kind of the most challenging sector emissions from the new newest consumption of products   we just wanted to take a moment to talk about the different aspects of implementation and the different players that are required so obviously realizing full implementation of the very ambitious plan to meet the goal of net zero by 2040 is   25220 pm  going to require action and leadership across every possible sector so that includes these different areas of government but the community we cannot as government tackle these problems alone we need partnerships and collaboration with the community writ large to accomplish many of our goals theres a lot we can do on our own with our department activities programs initiatives and policies but its going to take more than that i also did just want to mention looking at the city council city managers office office of sustain ability three pieces of the pie theres representation across all three participating in the climate and environment leadership team that meets bimonthly to oversee the implementation of the plan to tackle challenges and problems and provide feedback on where were going with the plan and that blue piece about the community action year   25320 pm  working right now  were working trying to figure out how to bring more resources more levers more strategies to galvanize increased community action thats something were excited about were excited about bringing back our progress on that because we think theres a lot more that could be done in that blue slice of the pyramid next slide   so getting into implementation as shown on the last slide the office of sustainability has this role of coordinating and leading and reporting and summarizing but most of the actual like real implement work is happening at the department level so one of the role important things we do is work across all the departments and try to understand the status of all of the actions and activity happening across all of our different departmental partners summarize all that information and report it so one of the first things weve done and started this before the plan was even   25422 pm  developed is try to understand  not developed was  before it was adopted and being implemented was to understand where actions and strategies are in the plan and where they are in the time line of being implemented so just the chart here sort of breaking down the 74 strategies in the plan and where they fall in terms of things that are already underway departments are taking action are implementing some form or fashion of something that is connected to a strategy in the plan the second category is actions that are likely going to be in the proposed fy 23 budget which there will be more communication about that very soon then the third section is strategies that havent been started yet so things that are longer term things that are likely twoplus years out of the future if you look at the  sum total about twothirds of everything in the plan should be underway in some form or fashion by later this year there is going to be a lot more detail coming in this implementation dashboard   25522 pm  that im going to talk about in a couple slides next slide just to highlight other recent efforts the office of sustainability is this coordinator leader sort of role in the city but were going everything we can to make sure theres forward momentum with implementing the plan i have been the project manager on developing the resilience hubs in our community thats connected to the private equity plan certainly connected to climate action but its the same thing our office has been spending time on the second thing is the climate equity plan story map we created this a few months ago its a story map that walks through very clearly whats in the climate equity plan and makes it very accessible for anyone in the community to understand whats in the plan the next is the youth climate equity council we partner with eco rise over the last year with the screen shot is these are a bunch of high school   25622 pm  students part of our youth climate equity council they were engaged what is understanding whats in the plan and a eco rise and ut and aid to understand how high school students can be involved with moving forward initiatives in the climate plan regional collaboration has been one of the overarching parts of the plan we hosted texasnew mexico regional meeting that had sustainability climate staff from houston dallas san antonio waco plano el paso albuquerque all over our region to talk about climate planning implementing climate plans and share best practices on that rocky mountain institute has been coordinating these texas learning cohorts which are cities across texas connecting on topics the two were participating   25723 pm  in are on resilient subs and transportation inaudible we have been working basically having monthly meetings with the ut planet texas 2050 folks to try to figure out a collaboration framework between their research priorities and priorities of professors at university of texas and how do those things connect in with the climate plan and how can we drive more action the joint sustainability committee they have monthly meetings which my office supports they recently changed the bylaws to add five new members they are going to be nominated by you all and hopefully support implementation of the five new sections of the plan and then finally as lucia mentioned ongoing climate and lead ship meetings held every other months its really getting into the nuts and bolts of implementation within the   25823 pm  city organization next slide    so a little bit on those additional resources weve been able to identify at least at this juncture to help with the implementation of the plan those four existing ftes under the staffing support that are being reclassified to support resilience hubs and also the mass care branch and some other efforts within hesome might seem disconnected from the plan per se but the reason there is a real nexus there is as zach mentioned he and his team has jumped in to leading the resilience hub to dated that leadership came when the urgency of the work very clear but at the same time at that moment we did not have a chief resill only officer in place now that laura has arrived were working closely with her and hesome to rebalance the workload to transition   25926 pm  that initiative our office will still be involved in it but we really need to rebalance that workload to allow zach and his team to get refocused on the climb plan and its implementation its been a real overload for staff for a while so were very excited about this new staffing support coming online so i think thats going to really put some wind in the sails for our team to be able to continue to support the resilience hub work but also drill in on a lot of the other projects and implementation to the climate plan ill pass it back to zach for the rest of the slide   there are two other staff members brought on soon a program where cities apply and get professional staff to come work for us on a topic and then theres also a ull  ut lbj school   30027 pm  two other things when we went looking for resources and projects that needed immediate funding and support we found funding for enhanced climate activities so were making a new climate equity plan video and were going to likely be making a video about climate ambassadors this will give us more funding and resources to create those videos but also promote those videos our climate videos in the past have been on tv kxan were moving in that direction the other thing is there is a lot in the plan about existing buildings new buildings and hv a c systems heat pumps and electrifying in buildings this funding is to do research in our local hvac contractor market and figure out where the levers are to drive more electrification and high efficiency heat pumps throughout our community next slide a really exciting thing   30128 pm  were working on right now which is going to be very useful to the community and to city council is this implementation dashboard so this is going to provide transparent reporting on all 74 strategies in the plan as well as quantitative tracking on the goals this page is just an example what its going to look like this is just one sort of mockup page but were essentially going to  were going through the process right now of having all the departments answer these questions of whats the status of the strategy thats in the plan where are they in terms of implementation whats next how does equity fit in how does the community fit in and what are challenges and issues going on with each of these strategies were in the process right now of collecting data from all of our like 15 department partners  on these 74 strategies were probably about halfway done my hope is by the end of july this is live its posted on the city website   30229 pm  open data platform so this will be accessible by anyone to see status on everything in the plan next slide okay the next two slides are just a brief update on climb ambassadors youve probably heard of the program we created this program during the creation of the plan the folks you see on the screen were the first cohort of ambassadors we have now brought on a staff member and went through a whole process to determine how do we launch the second version of this program and how do we make it better than the first time around and improved and even more helpful to our climate efforts this is going to be a paid opportunity for community members to support equitable implementation of the plan its going to be focused on engaging historically under served communities who are most impacted by climate change and its really going to be focused on prioritizing local community initiatives the ambassadors will partner with the city to create community action projects next slide   30331 pm  so we went through a whole process to design the program the application program design how the program is expected to work the application process is open right now so between now and june 22nd we are taking applications for ambassadors from the community and are looking to hire 10 to 15 this summer the program will then launch for the ambassadors starting in august and run essentially six months and individuals will be paid 1500 for their time and up to 3000 for organizations that participate as an ambassador and the overall sort of process is ambassadors are hired theres going to be monthly coordination meetings theres going to be workshops in the beginning for community m embers to engage and understand whats in the climate equity plan focuses on equity and also civic engagement and then engage these individuals will engage with communities and design community action projects that will be focused on things in the plan and the   30431 pm  city will then sort of be helping and supporting their efforts to really get grass roots efforts off the ground in communities focused on the plan   if anybody here has ideas or contacts within your networks and your districts that you think might be good for this program please send them our way   and so finally whats next and whats happening right now we have a edf climate core foal he we have one that just started she is focused on equity metrics analysis the title of the plan is climate equity and its easy to measure things like energy and vehicles but measuring actual equity outcomes is more challenging so were diving into how do we actually make that a reality   for those that might not know edf is the environmental defense fund nonprofit   were holding implementation workshops with some community members and city staff to create    30532 pm  more excitement and focus around implementing the plan the first was last week and a followup one in july theres been conversation about a new implementation forecast the joint sustainability is the main conduit to oversee implementation of the plan but during the creation of the climb plan we had this  climate plan we had a steering committee made up of citizens that volunteered their time so theres now the conversations with the community about more community involvement and oversight and participation in the plan implementing the plan as i said implementation dashboard will be complete and launched in july hopefully climate ambassadors the kickoff and recruitment is underway austins first ever food plan is kicking on of this summer we have hired a consultant and are now starting  going to be starting the process very soon to kick off this regional food plan for our community   a part of that will be   30632 pm  food resilience as well as lowering the carbon footprint of food in our community   and we have gathered a ton of information this spring from departments on items that are in the climate equity plan and are in their budget proposals and we are looking to make this sort of full summary of those activities basically made available as part of the budget proposal when it comes out and then finally we are looking for the next council briefing that we do later this year more departmental project focus based we have these five sections of the plan he have we have these 15 departmental partners and we want to get into the nuts and bolts and details whats happening so likely the next briefings will be not so much us talking about the bigger picture framework but talking about the details of implementations in departments   were hoping to come back   30732 pm  with that next briefing this fall sometime has not been scheduled next   thank you   mayor adler thanks for the presentation im really looking forward to the dashboard its pretty exciting addition mayor pro tem   alter thank you i think its really important that we have these opportunities to hear from you and understand where the plans implementation is i think its important for the community this is are a vast undertaking with the goals weve set with the staff and community to get there though we have to make the investments and i appreciate that you were understaffed and restaffed on to resilience and that is not a fault of your unit but i am frustrated that the only thing were getting at this midyear is were getting our staff back who were assigned    30833 pm  to this in the first place again thats not a criticism of you but when we put together the implementation resolution and we asked for a midyear budget it was because we wanted to prioritize implementation of the climate equity plan instead what we had is staff charged with that were reassigned without coming up with the inaudible and we dont have any midyear budget amendment so i would like to first of all ask how much was the onetime funding and where do it come from for the enhanced climate communications activities and the hvac contractor study that seems to be the only midyear things bought im not sure if that was new money or your money pre purposed   the amounts were 50000 for each one of those initiatives so 100000 total   alter okay so we spent 100000 that we werent planning on the climate equity plan since it   30933 pm  passed in december despite a resolution that said we need to do have a midyear budget amendment thats problematic to me im not saying that repurposing that wasnt the right first step but we have got to lean in and have staff to lead this and so i guess i  im not exactly sure how to frame this question but i will call my colleagues attention to the fact we had memo in february that had a chart about implementation and the strategy that said about 10 of the stuff was going to be fund understand the midyear budget amendment we have instead seen 100000 funded and the new chart on the strategy status has over 11 percentage points now put into long term which is essentially   31033 pm  what we didnt do in the midterm is now being pushed to the long term so i really need to understand what is the plan for this fiscal year 23 budget what are you coming back with us with what is the universe of things that you are asking for help me understand that   sure i understand your frustration i hear you i would    alter i dont mean to direct  im frustrated with the process and i want to be clear this is not meant at you personally it is the overall process for prioritizing sustainability and climate equity within our system   understood no problem i did want to point out one additional thing that was funded and also just the fact that the pretty intensive exercise that the team went through to work with all the departments on what was in the plan make   31135 pm   sure they were clear on these are all the things approved and how are we going to get them done that process alone really helped the departments get ready for this budget proposal that you will be receiving so i think that work was very much time well spent and there are going to be things coming forward in the proposed budget and as zach mentioned there will be a highlight document that will go through what we think some of the most important projects are in the proposed budget that will implement the climate plan the one that you didnt hear about  and the other piece thats useful in these exercises which we discovered that when you start kind of kicking the tires on these things sometimes the departments are able to creatively come up with ways to pay for things they didnt realize they had the resources for so you know in one caseworking with you ban forestry there was   31238 pm  investing in software  that was part of the natural system section and there was a cost of 113000 allocated to that need and that team actually found the resource unallocated funds in existing budget to get the project done thats part of the benefit that we can get more creative with the resources that we do have i know that my boss jason has stepped up so im going to let him respond as well   good afternoon mayor and council jason alexander chief of staff just to kind of parrot what she said i think this was an important learning exercise for departments i will say we share that desire to be further ahead than we are right now we saw this as what we know we can do right now with existing resources we were happy to bring that forward as im listening to the conversation one for the fy 23 budget we are working with the budget office now to consolidate what those   31338 pm  investments will be and well be getting that to you all and just in thinking through this conversation in the short time ive chief of staff its conceivable that we are perhaps one learning cycle behind your expectation on this but we are committed to getting it done this work kicked off right after the adoption and its just frankly taken us this long to bring to you what we have   alter thank you i appreciate your candor on that i guess i feel like you know we pushed off the climate equity plan because of concerns about the timing and so in my mind were already a year behind and then we consistently get all of our sustainability and climate recommendations just after budget and then they dont get fund understand the next budget and were waiting and we cant wait we do have a climate emergency i would like to ask when you   31439 pm  provide us with the recommendations of what will be in the budget that we are also made aware of everything that was asked for that would have been under this that was not funded we need to have more transparency about the choices that are being made through this process and our ability to say that we want to weigh something else in addition i think its grated if we can find creative ways to repurpose other funding and put it towards climate im not objecting to that i think we should be doing that because its a crisis and wee need to address it we need to account for it so we near whether were  leaning into the strategy weve laid forward for ourselves or not and so i think its going to be really important that we have that transparency the current chart you know has funding being kicked off for 27 of the plan thats a lot in this budget   31539 pm  and so i really am hopeful that that chart is representing a reality and that we will see that and obviously there are many pieces here that are you know already underway like project connect and the electrification of buses and there are lots and lots of pieces that come together in that so mr cronk or whoever is doing the budget piece please make sure we have the utmost level of transparency there so that we can do that im going to ask one last question and after other folks have question councilmember fuentes asked me to ask questions on her behalf i wanted to get a better idea you know one of the biggest challenges in achieving sustainability and this is not going to come as a surprise because weve had this conversation multiple times is that to address the climate challenge we have to do things   31640 pm  interdepartmentally and the sustain jacket office is not in charge of those and i think well see that in future briefings can you tell me more about the leadership structure and how the bimonthly meetings are working and give examples of concrete things that have come out of those meetings pushing forward either on the climate equity plan or with respect to sustainability and climate   the climate environment leadership team i think is what you were specifically asking about mayor pro tem that group has been i would say vital to our process because it has given zach and our team to interface with assistant managers and department directors i have more of an opportunity to do that than zach does and the leader of this initiative i dont know if i can give specific examples other than   31741 pm  to say really knowing were in lock step together and that we can problem solve something has been extremely helpful to our efforts so jason i dont know if you want to add anything or zach   i dont have anything to add specifically other than i think ive sat in one of these since inserting  into becoming the new role and it was a thoughtful discussion it was educational for me only because i got to learn a little bit more about the a triple c program we have another meeting in the next month and so ill be looking forward to being in this place playing a more active role in that   alter thank you i hope in the future youll be able able to highlight work but the success depends how people show up for that meeting and what they are bringing to the table and how those conversations play   31841 pm   out again im being tough on you because this is so important i think every one of the resolutions that you cited were mine the texas gas and implementation obviously was cosponsored supported by colleagues as well but this matters and we have to get it right and we have to make sure you have the support and resources that you need and the other departments to actually make meaningful change so mayor i will pass it on back to you and when appropriate i have some questions that councilmember fuentes asked me to ask   mayor adler councilmember ellis   ellis im curious into the data collection showed the different levels from 2010 to 2020 when is the 2021 information going to be available ive seen a lot of data collection in various conversations that theres a lag in collecting that just   31942 pm  in the past two years people have been working on other things in the city but just data collection across the country   the 2021 community gas inventory will be completed this fall we  the thing that holds it up is federal reporting to epa on like large industrial facilities in the community those get reported to epa flight and when they become available in september october we can complete the full inventory lit be done before the year is out which is over a year late but its when the data comes   ellis is the expectation that it would be annually updated or are there midyear opportunities    the communitywide inventory is done annually   ellis so it will be updated once a year we talk about being the last big city in texas thats still in epa ambient air quality standards and were proud of that but i know for   32044 pm  yall to be successful in trying to make these big changes happen for our community and help us monitor how these changes are happening we have to be proactive about not making it worse on the front end theres only so many response you can do for climate impacts before you are having to be reactive instead of proactive i was fascinated to see that transportation chart come down obviously we know as soon as the pandemic hit all the roads were empty for a some listening time gave  long time i think you know as we had that conversation about teleworking and pio has an item on this and councilmember alter has worked on telecommuteing i want to make sure as we help businesses understand impacts on climate too that we take a proactive approach to trying to figure out ways not to have everybody back on the road   32145 pm   mopac is bumper to bumper at 330 in the afternoon clearly something is changing and i want to make sure were all hands on deck as far as affecting traffic patterns and congestion and the air quality impacts   mayor adler councilmember kitchen   kitchen thank you and thank you  thank you mayor pro tem for all the questions i thought those were very helpful to understand whats happening and thank you councilmember ellis also for your questions i just have one i think maybe we havent covered yet and that is i had thought at one point we were talking about a steering committee that would either potentially with a subset of the sustainability committee or the new committee can you tell me the status was that   it was on the second to the last inside were still in discussions with the community about how   32245 pm  do we copy that group and how do we focus what the group is going to be working on you know we already have the joint sustainability built the initial had been about forming a working group but that didnt get a lot of traction now this workshop we had last week and were just in ongoing discussions on who would be on a group like that what power do they have what is the scope of what they focus on and how do we make it useful because during the creation of the climb plan we had a cheering  climate plan a steering committee that had a clear role and that was to give me direction on oversight whats going object on the climate plan as we move to implementation this is department budgets happening throughout the city the city system and structure and one you know one oversight group its not exactly clear where they   32346 pm  fit within all the other structure we have   kitchen what do they think about it the sustainability committee have they recommended a particular approach   theres been discussion of them having a working group but thats still connected to a group   if i could add on    kitchen it seems like its been a long time since the action plan as well as since the mayor pro tems implementation and the steering committee would be one of the first things you guys are still trying to figure how they might fit or whats going on in terms of a steering committee not being created yet   ill give you my perspective councilmember i believe the joint sustainability committee which is a  its like a commission of commission   32448 pm   its con tooted of representatives from multiple other boards and commission in my view that body or a committee subcommittee they could choose to create would be the logical body to connect back to staff has spent a lot of time over the last six months trying to work more closely with the joint sustainability can i because they have  committee because they are on   board or commission i think its challenging for them to be frank because its a big time commitment so our team has been trying to work individually with each member to try to help them kind of hone in on the particular section of the plan that relates back to the other board and commission that they represent so that they can try to have that connectivity back to the other body i think were making progress there standing up at a separate   32548 pm  steering committee on an ongoing basis is frankly a huge amount of staff work and we already staff two boards and commission the joint sustainability and with a relatively small team from my perspective im hesitant to take on another standing body that we would have to manage from my perspective i would prefer and jack has been encouraging the joint sustainability committee to create a subcommittee that could be under the jsc   kitchen so whats holding up them creating one have they asked to hold it up or  have they asked to create one   they recited  they recited a working group   kitchen do they have support to meet   working groups around required to have full staff   kitchen for them to be effective they would need yalls support to meet   32650 pm   not necessarily we have committees of other boards that dont have staff support they just selforganize   kitchen theyve created a working group is that what you said   yeah   kitchen have they asked for support   yeah   kitchen is that something you all have the band width to provide   i mean    currently no   kind of yes and no    kitchen it sounds like that may be an issue for making it actually work okay all right well we can have further conversations about thissen a might want to talk to mayor pro tem about it but i would like to fall up with you   sure   mayor adler i think the comments relative to the things that are on our plate to do that we need to do and need to do with urgency are really well taken because this is a crisis and we need   32752 pm  to be doing our part and there have been requests from council that it would be good to have better followup and more timely followups so we can track them better and thats one of the reasons im excited about the dashboard that you are putting into place because i think thats going to be a real good place for people to monitor whats happening and where there are opportunities but you also said something i think thats real important which is we also have to take measure of the things that are  that we are doing that are going really well and its real encouraging and great to hear that our per capita carbon emissions have gone down by 37 recently im in the environment in lots of different forms with cities and jurisdictions some national groups around the country and around the world and i think one of the most useful and important things that the   32852 pm  city of austin is doing is providing that example to other cities only five cities or four or five cities in the country that have set the 2040 goal that we have set and im real confident of our ability to meet that goal and we need to but were in a select group and the work that we are doing is being used by other subnational groups around the world as the example i think the chart that you gave us thats on page 4 of the handout is one thats worthy of pausing on for just a moment that shows pretty precipitous decline this the greenhouse gas emissions over the last several years in both electricity and in transportation which are our two big areas it looks like our decrease in just the last few years in those two areas exceeds our total greenhouse gas   32954 pm  emissions in industrial refrigerants and waste combined thats pretty dramatic progress for a city to be making i put that all in the context of we all have to be making that kind of dramatic progress and more and we need others around the world doing the same thing and i appreciate and join in the comments earlier about the urgency and following through on the things and trying to figure how we set that up institutionally in our system but i also commend you and the staff and the city generally the community generally for the conservation measures that people are taking for the reduction in a footprint that is being driven as you say by more than city operations but by everybody   33054 pm   in the community it is impressive and were recognized for that impressive work around the world im going to turn the chair over to you thank you   alter thank you does anyone else have questions otherwise ill ask councilmember fuentes questions seeing none so she wanted me to ask about the status of the hiring of the two hesome staff who will support resiliency work do we know in theyve been hired and brought on board yet   so those two positions have just been reclassified and moved over to hesome so well begin that hiring process but we have to check with the director   alter once that is moved over what parts of the equity plan will be priority sized and supported   33156 pm  by the sustainability stuff i assume the resiliency is not doing the climate equity   its a blend of staff that are all working on this but we will get the dashboard off the ground were going to be launching the climate ambassadors program and do more detailed followups with apartments and identifying priorities for their implementation it will just enable us to do more coordination of more support of departments   and that communities engagement piece we were talking about we dont really yet know whats going to come out of that in terms of you know identifying new opportunities for us to work with the external sector and so im excited about the opportunity for us to really be able to dig into that much more deeply and to you know build some additional relationships with folks in the community   33258 pm  including you know philanthropic organizations and foundations so i think theres a lot more opportunities for us to be looking for additional resources vegetables we know all the resources cant come from the city   alter thank you all thats a really important part we have our plan and part of what were doing is setting up that ecosystem for everyone to be able to invest and have incentives to do that i think thats really important her last question what other challenges remain in prioritizing the climate action and proceeding with implementation   ill provide a couple of thoughts and please chime in i think we have more work to do in the green jobs area you know were very excited about the austin civilian conservation corps that you helped to initiate mayor pro tem that program is still in a fledgling stage really there are other workforce   33359 pm  development green jobrelated activities that could be explored and we havent had a chance to dig into that fully i think thats an area for us to be looking at more i think some of the other areas you know  that are more kind of out on the edge you know we talk about the fugitive emissions some of the stuff from the semiconductor industry theres other opportunities we dont have our arms around we know theres areas we need to work on further were not sure we have all the levers we need to actually drive change in those sectors those would be a couple of my thoughts   yeah the other only one i would mention would be regional cooperation were good at collaborating with other cities that have sustainability stuff but our most nearby suburban austinite neighbors dont have sustainability staff   33500 pm  figuring hot out how do we connect figure out how can we better coordinate or support them or help them find resources to be more aligned with solutions is an ongoing challenge but needs to be a priority   alter on the green jobs since you mentioned it i think you are well aware but for my colleagues as we go into budget its my understanding ut in  is working on a study for opportunities for green jobs in our community and what that needs to look like and kind of some of the investments that need to happen both financially but in terms of programs and policies that need to be set april  set up for that i dont know if thats going to come out in time for the proposed budget but there are a lot of opportunities in there and would encourage   33602 pm  us to consider that  those ideas as we go into budget as well thank you very much and again i just want to you know reiterate what the mayor said that you know what austin has accomplished is impressive what we have accomplished we have done because we set goals and we worked really hard to provide the resources that we need to do reach those goals we now have an updated plan and i think we need to push forward with even more resolve than we had before and more resources because the challenges are even greater none of that takes away from the success that weve had as a community as a city in moving these things forward it does mean that we need to lean in and really push this forward and as leaders in this area for the city you have an opportunity and a responsibility to partner with us and make sure that we know what we need to do to make sure you have the   33702 pm  resources to reach the goals weve set not ourselves thank you anyone else that anyone wants to bring up before i adjourn the meeting okay it is now    thank you   alter thank you very much its now 335 and i will adjourn this meeting thank you ')"

approved minutes  part 1 91239 am  mayor adler okay we can hear you were going to go ahead and convene the june 7th 2022 work session austin city council were in the boards and commissions room 910 we have a quorum present we have paige  indiscernible its been suggested to us that we start with the living wage briefing because were going to lose some people so lets start with that we can do the pulled items which may take us awhile today because i think theres actually work to be done with us on those issues to better understand where people are if we finish and have time before lunch we can go into executive session start   91339 am  today the  we just have our four appointments going through that personnel reviews im going to be off the dais from noon to 100 we could either just be taking a lunch break collectively at that time or if you wanted to work on executive session i could miss that but well come back this afternoon into this place at 100 we can do the homelessness update when we come back theres a briefing i think thats been handed out at 130 as close to that as we can well go into the austin energy meeting which i understand madam chair is about an hour we think for that and that would have us coming back at about 230 to finish executive session if we need to do   91442 am  that executive session it will be done virtually today yes mackenzie    kelly thank you for the recognition i wanted to daylight something thats been bothering me a little bit and the constituents about the briefings not being posted online in an amount of time that were actually able to review them and come up with questions and really dig into the information i feel like it really puts us day disadvantage on council to not have that information in a timely manner i know that this morning for example at 658 am our briefing came in about the homelessness issue but theres still no living wage briefing available online i would liable to ask we have those available 24 hours in advance of the meeting i would hate to bring forward a resolution to require that but it would be extremely helpful for myself and the community to have those available thank you   mayor adler thats a good point and its recurrent its something that we have raised collectively   91543 am  i join in that request yes councilmember kitchen   kitchen im concerned about the homeless briefing i dont want that to get squeezed out of time theres some very important things for us to discuss including the real estate aspect of it and the potential for new shelter locations so i was hoping that we would take it this morning is it possible  its very important that you be there for it mayor and im concerned that if we  im concerned were going to run out of time so is there a reason why you dont want to do it this morning   mayor adler because there are so many things that are important for thursdays work we really have to do the pulled items and work through those but well have time and i will be here for that because i want to be here obviously its a huge priority for me   kitchen okay can we commit to taking it up when we come back from lunch regardless of whether were finished with the   91643 am  pulled items   mayor adler thats what i was recommending at 100 we turn to that item and have that time before we do the    kitchen even if were not finished with pulled items i think that will be important   mayor adler lets see where we are on that we have too many things that are important today but i understand the importance of that and were not going to lose that   kitchen okay i mean i guess  okay   mayor adler okay all right lets go ahead and get started if we can manager    mayor and council good to see everyone this morning as the mayor mentioned were going to start todays work session with a briefing from the living wage work group so as some context as you may know eight years ago in 2014 the council passed a resolution directing the manager to provide staff support for a stakeholder process to develop recommendations regarding the citys living wage rates and policy during that process stakeholders met seven times and then provided the recommendation to council at that time a plan was developed then to increase the living wage from 1139   91748 am  to 15 over five years by 2020 fast forward to today earlier this year a living wage stakeholder group convened again and provided an updated recommendation to council that recommendation was sent via memo from our hr director on april 28th and to councilmember kellys point we should post that in backup and ill make sure that that happens because i dont believe theres a presentation today its just the recommendation of the memo that was given to you on april 28th but ill make sure that gets in backup as well on this time the group met four times and we are here today to receive a briefing on that living wage from members of this community working group as you know as part of the budget process i will bring forward a compensation package that includes increases to the living wage across the board increases and other compensation recommendations for our hardworking dedicated city employees so with that im going to turn it over to members of the working group who will walk through their   91850 am  recommendations   its always something if its not on the computer its here good morning everyone it is an honor to be here in front of you today and as you heard from the city manager weve also passed out the proposal back from 2015 so i wanted to say a little bit about the economic situation in austin though austin has the best job market in the nation we know that austin is suffering from rising housing costs we know that austin is no longer ranked one of the top   91950 am  10 that austin has dropped down to 13 and all of that is due to the rising cost of housing i mention that because we are trying to keep our employees in housing were trying to keep them at the workplace and it has become a significant challenge for them we need to move back to basics we are taking this opportunity eight years later the report says that we should have ended at 1683 and for some reason  we never applied the cpi to keep the living wage moving so our ask for 22 sounds astronomical we know that the employees are doing more with less   92052 am  we know they are working mandatory overtime we know that we have employees working out of their classification we have admin staff still taking 911 nonemergency calls we have park rangers providing support to the youth programs and it goes on and on we know that arr has a contract because the services are being impacted because we are not able to keep low wage earners we are losing them to the private sector we know the private sector is a 20 22 24 they dont have to keep the 15 and we are at an alltime vacancy rate of 18 in just   92154 am  the general fund department it is time to take care of our house to take care and restore operations to the stens of austin and we need your help to do that we cannot do anything about inflation we cant do anything about what it costs to fill up your car but the one thing we can do that you can do you can give your employees the wages needed to survive in this economy thank you   good morning council my name is rachel melendez i work for unite here were a hospitality union we represent the concessions workers at the airport i really wanted to spend a couple of minutes sharing a little bit about their experience i know some of you have   92254 am  already met with them youve heard from them directly what its like there but really if your flown out of the airport you have seen a lot of the shops are closed the retail are closed places you can get a magazine those places are closed because they are understaffed weve heard from folks that people are quitting work at the airport because of the demand because of so many people flying through the airport it is too stressful theyre overwhelmed theyd rather go work somewhere else to make the same money where its less demanding for those of you who dont know they start work at 330 in the morning a lot of times they leave at noon or 200 in the afternoon their whole day is spent at work and theyre not able to support their families thats really the majority of what i wanted to share i think theres a opportunity for the council to not just affect the lives   92354 am   of the folks who will be taking home these paychecks but really raise the floor for the city so thank you   hell row everyone i am the austin policy director with workers defense and we represent low wage construction workers and what weve been seeing with our members as well has been that the folks that have been constructing the city that have been making these fantastic hirises the buildings the housing were all in they are not reaping any of the benefits many of our members have lived in austin and have ended up moving over to buda to kyle other areas in the central  in the central area so theyre able to still continue to work however not able to live here and thats why we really support an increase in the minimum wage construction workers especially those on public projects would be the direct beneficiaries twentytwo dollars an hour is a starting place   92454 am  we believe that they still  that its still not a living wage however its something that would be brought back to their families its a way for folks to continue to build their lives here in austin and we really hope that you all support the living wage going up to 22 an hour   good morning my name is jeremy hendrix and im with the laborers international union and also vicepresident of the local building trades and i appreciate the invitation this morning to come speak to you ill remind you that ive served on every living wage task force before we passed the living wage before 101 and austin has always been behind although achieving 15 by twin was early unfortunately we stopped there and during the pandemic whereas carol said city workers have worked longer hours to provide services to folks to make sure that theyre safe and survive this pandemic they have been left behind so not raising the wage   92558 am  since 2018 is completely unacceptable and i will remind you that this does extend to contracts right now we have a lot of competition in the market when it comes to construction there are huge projects coming up and its getting harder and harder to find work ers because they candidate afford to live here and we cant afford to pay poverty wages anymore the dangerous work that they do absolutely deserves better pay and when you have massive projects coming up  ill remind you this also extends to project connect project connect which now has ballooned to over 10 billion it will be impossible to find workers so its important that we pay the workers to have projects on time and on budget but to ensure we have high quality on those projects and to get the best skilled workers we have to pay the 22dollar wage and thats still below many crafts its a starting point as fab owe la said to make sure were more competitive and get back on track i ask you to do the work thats so important and to    92659 am  use discretionary funding or whatever is at your access when we are one of the wealthiest cities in america we have to take care of our workers   i am the director of st johns episcopal church and a leader with central texas interfaith weve been fating for living wages since 2022 we fought to ensure that companies looking for city incentives required to pay living wage we were part of the task force that recommended that the city employees would get paid 1683 that was the recommendation by 2020 it is now 2022 and were still at 15 city employees are the workers they are the ones who pick up our trash they fill the potholes theyre the ones who make sure that our children are safe when they go to the pool theyre the ones who make sure that there are librarians in the library and theres somebody there to encourage children to   92759 am  read and theyre not just workers theyre also members of our congregations theyre parents in our schools and theyre our neighbors members of my own congregation are worried whether or not that our city employees whether they will be able to stay here in austin the high cost of living makes it difficult for our city employees to live in the city that they work in increasing the minimum wage as you heard increases other peoples wages employees who work for companies that contract with the city construction workers as well as employees of companies receiving tax abatement from the city causing a positive ripple effect on thousands of people who are struggling to make ends meet we all on you to increase the city living wages to 2022 this year think about it thats only a little over 40000  45000 a year as has been said its not enough but its a start and to add that by 2027   92900 am  were at 27 an hour   does anybody have any questions i would really advise you to read the proposal we passed out to you because its like were doing it again we did it eight years ago and for whatever reason it didnt move there was a solid recommendation in there we had mr  oh my goodness  osterman from mit who helped us and shared a lot of very valuable information at the time and here we are eight years later doing the same thing again having a committee talking about making a recommendation looking at the numbers trying to be smart but the difference is today we didnt know  we couldnt have foreseen the   93001 am   pandemic we couldnt have foreseen the storm and those additional stressors have played a big role in where were at today but somethings got to give we need more workers we cannot hire workers those who work here theyre done theyre spent they need your help weve got to be competitive we have got to raise the wage for these workers please when you go through the budget process its a very large budget and there are a lot of decisions and special programs that people want i get that but usually those programs are staffed with workers and if we cant hire the workers we cant do your programs so help us help you to get   93101 am  things done for this community because these employees they love working for this community but they just cant take it anymore something has to give and i think thats the wage so thank you for your time   mayor adler appreciate the presentation and the workment i know you guys have been working yet again on this as a working group since the beginning of the year so appreciate the time and effort that all of the dozen plus os that have participated in that and im sure im not alone in having conveyed to the manager in my conversations with him as a leadup to the budget that making sure that were competitive with our employees is the highest personal priority in terms of the budget that is moving forward and coming to us colleagues conversation or comments on this   93202 am  yes   is it on   yes thank you   i greatly appreciate the work of the liveable wage grouping and i appreciate you all sharing this memo that kind of highlights the history of leading up to setting the minimum  raising the minimum wage to 15 and knowing that we never got to 1683 and knowing that weve been four years at 15 per hour weve remained stagnant and the impact that has had not only on city operations but the impact its had on our communities colleagues we know that half of our swimming pools right now are not open because we dont have the lifeguards to fill them we also know that many of our departments have high vacancy rates i think i counted nearly 13 departments have a vacancy rate of over 20 at this time we know this issue is not   93302 am   unique to the city of austin many industries companies sectors are dealing with labor shortages so the fact of the matter is that we have to raise the wage in order to ensure that our hard working austinites can not only live in the city but afford and have a good quality of life and so we can deliver the services needed as a city government so for me im super supportive of raising the liveable wage i think that is the right thing to do i think its the responsible thing for us to do knowing how deep this issue is so i appreciate the work that has been prepared for us today one of the questions i have just to better understand why we didnt get to 1683 and i dont know city manager if youre able to speak to this or perhaps our hr director i wanted to see some context as to the previous working group laid out a pathway for us to reach 15 and then 1683 and then just knowing   93403 am  if you could share any insight as to why weve been at 15 for the last four years   thank you council member ill provide some because this was somewhat before my time so i know it was a commitment before i came on board to increase the rate in which we were able to get to 15 so i think that amount came sooner that was anticipated in the working group recommendation and for the previous staffs recommendation as you know with any budget there are the conversations around are you going to do an increase across the board increases for employees how do you ensure that there are the levers that youre going to be pulling and again what the manager approaches and what the council adopts on is a case by case and year by year basis we would have to go through each year to determine why we didnt move past the 15 but as has been noted weve been in a pandemic and had some challenges in just being able to support all of our employees and the hard working staff that we have   93508 am   fuentes i was talking to councilmember renteria before we started and he mentioned that capmetro will be paying their bus drivers 22 per hour so knowing just how much other sectors including public sector are moving towards lifting the wage that to me is an issue that i think we as policymakers can have and deliberate in the coming weeks and as part of the budget process so i look forward to that conversation thank you   mayor adler councilmember harpermadison councilmember kitchen and then councilmember kelly   harpermadison thank you chair i appreciate it so i couldnt agree more with council member fuentess recommendations but i also have to recognize that  i think all of us need to recognize that this is not going to be an easy process not going to be a simple process so like to your point about the programs that will fall short the programs that either will continue to exist or not and the people who will continue to live in the city of austin or not you know it sometimes    93608 am  sounds defeatist when im literally telling my constituents on occasion just prepare to move it sounds terrible right but prepare to have to live outside of the city of austin instead of waiting you know until youre six months in arrears on your rent go now because you know you have to go and that sounds defeatist and it makes my heart to have to say it but its drew so as were representing some of these really  were accepting the difficult truths about nobody being able to anticipate the winter storm nobody being able to anticipate  i dont think any of us truly felt the impact that covid has had on our society at large and i dont mean austin i dont mean central texas i mean internationally i really dont think any of us have any clue how much its impacted us so to say while i recognize that there are some special considerations it sounds condescending and trust me that is not my attempt i am saying though however as we move into the   93710 am  budget process this is my fourth one and every one has gotten more difficult than the last and every single time  the last one for example our budget office said hey guys dont ask for more than one thing weve got enough for you to ask for one thing and i asked for one thing you know and barely got that so recognizing that all my colleagues had multiple things that they had had to ask for because these were things that were relative and important i guess im curious and manager maybe you can help me with this im curious at what point do we solve  this working group for example i understand the level of frustration they must experience in saying hey we already told you guys what our recommendations are years ago so to have to come back and ask again theres a level of frustration and it possibly  seems like the city is not behind you and thats certainly not the case but when you recognize the wide spectrum of the of our constituents so our constituents are workers our constituents are private sector workers our constituents are private   93811 am  businesses that have to pay workers that have to figure out whether or not they can open their doors that so to figure out if they can stay in business its everybody in our situation where we have to consider everybody and everything that comes out of  i know it seems like a large budget but the truth of the money is that money is finite theres only so much of it so having to figure out where things go is a part of the difficulty right so much of our conversation as of late especially about housing i really appreciate that you led with the conversation on how long its nonnegotiable thats one thing that we can do that will help our city at large help our workers at large make our city more affordable to live in which to the point about being a relative defeatist having to say youre not going to be able to afford to  live her that has to do with me taking the pulling of our state government and local government and the restrictions and saying youre not going to be able to live here if we dont make dramatic   93914 am  bold moves for housing capacity you wont be able to live here i think its twofold manager one how do we involve folks who arent policymakers around housing in a way that is substantive that really helps us as a body to move the needle on producing housing yield is not enough and its affecting everything we need more housing but more importantly when i think about our opportunities to involve the community in our discussions around making decisions with the budget are there any  i know theres the how would you spend the budget tools but honestly i would love to know people who are at risk people who have to move to niederwald and georgetown and bastrop county i would love to know if they had the opportunity to take a look at the list what would they select as the services that we could do without what would they select as the programmatic efforts we could do without what would they select as while i appreciate that this is important in terms of prioritization its third   94016 am  tier not first or second i wish the conversation were more collaborative and maybe selfishly at the end of the day when everybody doesnt get what they need its not the body thats the bad guy i want for us as a community to have to say this is our bucket of money how do we spend it and everybody has to make tough choices everybody has to determine if these resources are finite and something has got to give and i think not having to be the ultimate say in that having more contribution from the general community would be helpful that way its all of ours its not just ours as a body the otherness of that the community and the body i think the otherness is a part of our problem with the ability to work with the community how do we bring them into the conversation more on affordability ie housing and two the allocation of our budget   obviously a great conversation council member and although this   94116 am  isnt a budget presentation i look forward to both talking about the ways in which we have engaged with different community stakeholders throughout the budget process so far our boards and commissions weve had speakup austin and were going to be having town locals with many of you so this is just the beginning of how were going to be working with our community as we make those important decisions around how were prioritizing our limited resources especially with a three and a half percent cap that we have to work with but this is exactly why i love this city why i know each of  you are committed to this work because we have such an engaged community so i even see the next conversation that were going to be having on some of the pulled items on affordability is a way to say these are some of those policy decisions how do we make sure that the community is also engaged in those discussions as well this is just the start of it and i know that every year we have a robust community engagement process on our budget and i look forward to any other recommendations that you might have and how   94217 am  we can further engage our community in developing that   i appreciate that i dont think im the one to make the recommendations honestly i think its the working group to make the recommendations about how we can engage the community would any of you who presented this morning say that theres been a robust effort to participate on behalf of the workers who obviously need you know to not be stuck in this stagnant wage scenario are there contributing to the dialogue are they dialing into the website that says speak up here or whatever the thing i just  i know anecdotal aa lot of my constituents arent processing in those  participating in those processes so i wonder how robust it is the participation   i have no idea how many people are participating in this website but what i can tell you is the people at this table and the people that participate in the living wage task force represent tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of workers congregationalists and people in this town and throughout the city and central texas so a lot of our folks obviously cant afford to live in town the folks that are working on this construction site   94318 am  right over here i guarantee you dont live in town they live in smithville and elsewhere affordability is absolutely important but building apartment complexes requiring  i dont care if you require 80 affordability those are bandaids paying people more money is the best ripple effect you can get in the community because this not only extends to city employees people at the airport but also contracts it absolutely are going to have ripple effects that will affect hundreds of thousands of workers so it is absolutely the best decision and investment you could make i dont know if anyone else wants to add to that   kitchen yes i agree with what my  what my colleagues are saying and so theres just a couple of things i want to talk about in a bit more detail i i agree that housing is important and were going to   94418 am   start to work on that theres a lot more we need to do i also agree that wages are fundamental bottom line is what people can earn for their work is fundamental to their ability to live and so thats key to me to me people should have the ability to get paid what theyre worth and to live in the community so im wondering  im thinking also  i know city manager that you have made this a priority in terms of focusing on raising wages i have a couple of comments for you as you go through this process first off i think that  i think we need to do something different this time weve been talking right now about you know previous task forces that weve had that have set a path that we didnt follow for whatever reason so to the extent that we seat   94521 am  path this time needs to be done differently with some more assurety around it so that were not in the same situation that we are today you know i understand of course that next year year after that there may be unforeseen things but if we just do the same thing that we did last time were not moving the ball you know so theres that i want to say and i also think that hearing from the community is important but to do that the public has to understand the tradeoffs so one of the things that i think is really important in bringing forward some action on this item is to say city manager get us to 22 if you cant get us to 22 if thats not feasible tell us why and tell us what it would take because the kind of feedback thats been suggested which is great i really applaud and agree with the importance of the   94623 am  community being part of this decisionmaking to do that they have to understand what the tradeoffs are so if we just hear from you that its not feasible to get to 22 and we dont know why and we dont know whats the choices then we as a body and the community as a whole cant say   they cant say well you know wed rather pay wages you know wed rather make sure that were getting folks to a higher level its always important to have transparency in the budget process and we do have a process for that but the level of transparency if we cant  you know my goal is to get to 22 if its not feasible to get there you know i trust that you will tell us why and what our tradeoffs are so that we can  as a body i think thats our responsibility as a body to have that conversation   94723 am  and its our responsibility to have that conversation with the community so i would just ask that you do that and i want to thank you all for all the effort youve put in this and i know its really  i want to thank you for the effort which i think just you know doesnt say enough because people are dealing  with how they support their families how they live that is just huge and something that we need to take to heart so i want to thank yall for representing all the tens of thousands of people that you do   mayor adler council member kelly   kelly thank you thank you all for being here today you brought up some points that i had not yet been aware of and so i appreciate that background information it will definitely help us with this discussion i agree with council member harpermadison in that on council we have a lot of different ways to effect affordability in this city and one of those is building more housing my rent upon renewal went up hundreds of dollars and so im feeling that effect just like   94823 am  thousands of other people across the city and we really need to build more housing and make it easier for housing to be built here so that the people who are moving here can come here and the people who are staying here can stay here at a rate where theyre able to live their best lives the last thing i would like to see happen here is if we do raise the wages for people its cutting things the programs that our council has mitted to we have a goal right now to house 3000 individuals experiencing homelessness in three years and i would hate to go short of that goal because of the fact that we raise wages and those are things that we do have to consider especially when our revenue is capped one thing that you all mentioned was that there was an annual cost of 45000 a year could you help me understand that or maybe i misheard you   yes the 22 an hour is about  a little over 45000 a year so we have these numbers like oh theyre so big   94924 am  but when you actually look at somewhat somebody is earning a year then you realize why its so hard for people to live in austin   kelly i see   so its very difficult to live in austin earning a little over 45000 a year   kelly understood thank you for clarifying that for me im just curious city manager has city staff been able to do an analysis of how much this might cost in our budget   thank you council member the memo that was put out by director hayes she worked with the budget office and they have a range between 182 million and 228 million but those costs do not include sworn employees and we also have to do additional analysis on the impact on compression and so we wanted to make sure that as we move forward with the budget and some of these decisions that are being contemplated here that were able to provide as much transparency around some of  those decisions as possible so we have a general range but i wanted to put some caveats around that because it doesnt   95025 am  include the same increases of 22 for all of our sworn employees and the impact of some of the compression issues   kelly okay thank you very much thank you again for being here   mayor adler council member ellis mayor pro tem council member pool council member tovo   ellis thank you mayor yall will have to forgive me for saving my voice for some of the other conversations that were going to have today we absolutely cannot expect our city to be one of the best employers in town and to make sure that people can afford to live in this community if were not going to step up on having competitive wages like council member fuentes said we have lifeguards were trying to recruit we need to make sure we have camp counselors and it is about making sure that resource recovery has enough employees to make sure that we cannot only just pick up the routine trash and composting but doing brushy item pickup when we have situations like you know wildfire preparedness   95125 am  that were undertaking as a city so we absolutely have to step up and be a good employer and i know that year over year there has been incremental increases in the salaries that people are already receiving which is very much appreciated but weve got to make sure that we are recruiting and retaining the absolute best of the best to make us a proud city and a proud employer so i know this is something thats really important for me i know that a number of us have met with some of the lifeguards and the people who are advocating to raise that wage these are really important jobs and we absolutely have to make sure that our pools are open our libraries are open and that we continue to employ the best of the best   mayor adler mayor pro tem   alter good morning and thank you for your work every day and also on this project since 2020 when the pandemic   95226 am   hit ive been really focused on trying to understand what this means for our workers and our ability to recruit and retain and you know back in january my colleagues were on a call and we had a conversation about sd23 i said that we needed to add recruitment and retention of our workforce as one of our key prioriies and focus on that so you know for me keeping our workforce competitive is a high priority highest priority in the budget also been looking eats our 911 workers or victim services our cdl drivers et cetera so im really committed to a wage increase what council member ellis said i think its a how and when question which is our responsibility as a council to work in collaboration with the city manager and figure out  i do expect a significant wage increase i cant tell you whether 22 is   95326 am  realistic or feasible but i do expect an increase from 15 and im disappointed that we were not able to do it from 15 and want to understand why and have suggested that we need to have greater transparency in the budget so that council can really see where things are achieving this goal is going to be extremely difficult under a 35 budget cap it requires ongoing funding and so in order to be able to actually realize the recommendations and figure out what timeframe works we need answers to a lot of questions and i dont know city manager if youre prepared to answer those but i want to throw out some that i think are really important for us to be able to think about things for this were talking about essentially workers who are making 15 to 22 its unclear from the estimates   95428 am  at what point it cuts off with compression so we need to know what portion of our employees are making between 15 and 22 we also need to track where those vacancies are and are those vacancies tracking to the employees who are in the 15 to 22 range anecdotally theres also a whole lot of people who are above that range who are you know also leaving their jobs because of wages and this proposal doesnt provide them much of a bump in terms of the costs and we cant leave out those folks ive been you know really immersed in 911 and the folks who are threatening from the emergency communications to leave are people who are making above 22 because they have a lot more experience and they havent had their wages raised a 7 increase is a 40 increase for those who are at the lowest level but what does that mean for somebody who is making 30 who   95528 am  may be as valuable to the city and very critical we have a responsibility to be looking at this question and its ramifications all across the spectrum so we need to understand that we need to understand what portion of our budget overall is wages because were not just talking about general fund when we do this its all of our enterprise funds what does that mean for rates were talking about  affordability at this point i have no comprehension of what this means with respect to our sworn and our contracts that were looking to make sure that we are providing livable wages to our ems our police and fire which is 60 plus of our general fund alone and so anything we do for the livable wage has repercussions for those and financially we have to balance the budget and come up   95630 am  with that for compression who is included in the estimates for compression if you go up 7 and you have all these people who are making 28 29 30 and they dont get anywhere near that you create a whole host of challenges that have to be managed and that we cannot ignore because we want 22 and 22 i agree completely with council member kitchen that our community needs to understand the tradeoffs i think council also needs to understand the tradeoffs and the tradeoffs might involve people losing their jobs and so you know when we start cutting things or you know it may be that we cant increase the number of ems professionals or police or fire and then we create extra burdens in those areas we have to be able to think holistically it is a big challenge and the need is real   95731 am  but we have a lot of questions that need to be answered i do want to just reiterate that absolutely believe that we need a significant wage increase and we need a plan to get to a higher livable wage over time what we can accomplish is going to depend on you know getting these questions answered and seeing what the tradeoffs are and making some tough decisions im not prepared to make a decision before i know what those tradeoffs are and get those questions answered   mayor adler council member pool   pool thanks and i wanted to thank the living wage work group really sincerely for the work youve distilled concerns that we all share absolutely need to support higher wages across the board   95832 am  part of the reason we dont have a plan to get there is we dont actually know what the cost will be and what the tradeoffs are my role as a council member is to help make those decisions which is different than the role that the living wage work group has which is to advocate to isolate the specifics and then to determine recommendations and then to advocate for them and you are doing that really well and i very much appreciate that it is a spur and that is of course necessary i do think that some people who are leaving government work looking for higher wages at say a tech company theyll be back because working in corporate america is really really different from working in public service and you can lose your job in the blink of an eye and thats not the case here at the city of austin were a really  good place to work for a lot of reasons but yeah we need to address the salaries i like that you were focusing on   95934 am  the lowest wage earners thats key but what i dont see is equal addressing of the midrange basically what im calling the middle class you know there are a lot of government resources for people who make poverty wages or low incomes theres a lot of programs for these folks the wealthy dont really need government assistance because theyve got enough money that they can make due but ive been a member of the middle class my entire life and i dont get any support really from government programs at the bottom and i dont get any of the tax breaks that the people at the top get and i think im speaking for a majority of city of austin and government workers and ive basically worked in government my entire life with a few exceptions of a nonprofit here and a bank actually for about a year and a half when i first came to austin so its the middle class the middle wage earners that i really want to see embraced   100034 am  so i support what you are doing i support the mayor pro tems discussion about the tradeoffs and the need for a plan i urge that we as a dais look at our middle wage experienced  im going to use the word tenured i dont necessarily mean tenured but people who have been here 7 to 10 or more years they need to see that they are valued and we do in a capitalist society look at value available to people outside of government which is why im saying that i think even though people have gone to corporate america i think theyre going to be coming back i had a question for  maybe for our director of human resources and it has to do with the salary increases that we have gotten annually since we moved the minimum wage up to 15 did that minimum wage also   100135 am  reflection the additional 2 and 25 or whatever those percentage increases were over the year for the acrosstheboards that weve gotten and if you dont know right now id be happy to get the answer later but that would address the bottom so that 15 isnt always 15 it goes up by whatever the acrosstheboard is so thats one question i think it looks like assistant city manager resenio has an answer   good morning council member im going to ask director hayes to answer that question if she has the answer with her if not we will certainly get back to you with that answer she needs one moment    pool and while shes doing that id just reiterate that we need to retain experienced employees that is key for me   just while shes doing that i just want to point out while she gets settled i want to point out that middle class people who live in austin middle class theyre the ones who benefit from the libraries theyre the ones who benefit   100236 am  from the pools theyre the ones who benefit from all these services without them then theyre going to have to find other places for them to purchase those things and they dont have that kind of bandwidth   pool it sounds like youre agreeing with me   mayor adler thank you   yes i believe your question is the impact of the living wage and the acrosstheboard   pool right did that move the 15 up sequentially over time   so what we do is we raise the living wage and then whatever the acrosstheboard increase is for that year those employees will receive it as well so there are some employees who have not had the opportunity to be here long enough for the acrosstheboard it will still be at the 15   pool and this is where i was going with that we have never actually raised the minimum up from 15 even though we have given acrosstheboard raises to staff in a number of years i think the answer to that is yes   yes   pool and i think thats part of the issue that the living wage working group may have identified which is if we had   100337 am  been raising that 15 up to 15 23 or whatever the 25 or 2 would have been at that time then we would have progressed more toward that 16 which is what was in the 2014 recommendation   understood   pool so thats all im saying i just wanted to point that out   i would also point out that we also did other things between the time of setting the 15 an hour we then i think in 2016 we allowed temporary employees to also receive benefits once theyve been here  for a year we were able to give the covid bonus and so weve done other things but to the point that i think council and the city manager may   in creating those opportunities to do other things to address the issues of the moment we failed to move forward with the 1683 but we were doing other things to try to address those other overarching issues that came up during those periods   pool and to that point what is the benefits factor thats   100438 am  used to add to a persons salary to indicate the true fall of the work contract   so youre looking at the total compensation package and the percentage of contributions that the city makes in order to create that total compensation   pool thats right   thats not going to be something i could effectively communicate but certainly i can share with both the working group  by the way its been a pleasure to work with them and council as to the percentages you would need to add to that for total compensation i appreciate that council member pool because as we have this conversation the total compensation is going to be important because its not just what we provide in the hourly salary its also the contributions that the city provides in totality to benefits shortterm disability and the other things that we pay for that create that total package which we then use to compare and benchmark for competitiveness   pool at one pong i think the factor was about 20 it was 25 and it may be in the 30s at   100541 am  this point   theyre checking right now so well be able to provide that to you   council member pool can i just add something i think thats a great point you bring up although those 2 or 3 increases have happened that they havent affected everyone i just want to remind everyone that that also means they have not extended to contract employees   pool right   construction all those other things but also project connect which has already started we already have the metro rapid lines going   pool and i think thats a point that we can dig into and address    i also think if you read the report from 15 you will see that we were very concerned with compression back then thats why we made some of the decisions that we made compression and longevity for employees who have been in the workplace far   100642 am  long time is all part of this right and so we didnt go into this just thinking about this person at the bottom because when you make a change here it has a ripple effect as you go through the pay grades and so that was considered it was on the table it was considered eight years ago it is always always a priority for this unit   pool and thats really important that that compression is addressed all the way up through up to a certain point obviously and not just like the lower couple of groups in the wage bands my point is here on that is that that is not  a full assessment of that cost is not included in these numbers and that is what concerns me because if we are going to move   100742 am  in this direction we need to be cleareyed on the costs not only for fiscal 23 but for going forward and its the cleareyed part that is the difficult conversation thats going to happen on the dais and with the council and the city staff im not making any claims or promises or assessments about what thats going to look like except to say that it wont be simple and there has been some forecasting of what that could look like and i think thats accurate i think mayor pro tem went into good detail on that front   as we talk about that 1638 from the first report our goal was to finish at 1683 or be there by 2020   100843 am  were heading into 2023 so again had we used the cpi that we had put from the first so that we wouldnt be here today we would be at 1750   pool i understand i understand completely we cannot subtract out the effects of the pandemic over the last two years which essentially ground everything to a halt we didnt know what kind of support we would have from the federal government we have a sense of it now we are still trying to pull ourselves out of that situation to see what our revenues are like and what is actually going to continue because the world is different   yes i agree    pool thank you for that so ill just return and i think council member tovo is after me retaining experienced employees needs to be fully considered in whatever conversations we have going forward we need a plan for that and we need a way to   100944 am  sustain the level and grow it i dont think any of us have any quarrel with any of that i look forward to continuing that work just dont know how fast were going to be able to get there but i commit that i will do that work with you as you know i will   thank you   mayor adler i think parenthetically it is good to note as director hayes did that in this period of time weve made some pretty significant progress of other things weve extended benefits to the same group of people weve taken a lot of contract workers that were not getting benefits and converted those into employment positions so a lot of impactful work im real proud to have been part of a council that was doing things that should have been done a long time after that   101044 am  council member tovo i think you were next   tovo thanks so the conversation has gone a lot of different directions and i have a couple things to say about different points that others have raised i agree with my colleagues who have mentioned the importance of making sure that we have those robust conversations with the public i know most of us are probably going to have those public sessions about the budget as best as we can within that conversation it does pose authentic questions to the public because its really challenging going as a community member before i got on council in those days the conversations were kind of like what would you like to see more of everybody wants to see more of everything thats not a realistic way to approach it and so i do think its important not only to talk about the tradeoffs but the   101146 am  impacts and ive forgotten which of my colleagues mentioned this before but certainly the living wage  those of you on the living wage group have mentioned this as well that you know a lot of what our public wants to see more of really depends on having employees to staff it and so thank you for the work that youre doing thank you to my colleague for bringing this forward i think its critical that we address wages this cycle and that we do so as aggressively as were able to within our budgetary limits i would also ask the city manager to provide us with some information about vacancies you know i hear  anecdotally about different departments that are struggling i know ive reached out to some departments and theyve said its going to be a while until we can do that its going to be a while until we can respond because this person is out or this person is out were relying on some contracts for programs that weve typically done inhouse in part because of you know im hearing that theres such a high workload and so many vacancies but i really dont have a sense   i dont have a clear picture of what those vacancies are like and i dont know if ive missed a memo or we just havent   101247 am  been provided with that information but i would ask for that pretty quickly and also some information about which departments and at which levels i need it in preparation for the budget about a couple departments asking for kind of what are the different job titles some of the programs that fall within that and where are the vacancies were going back and forth with staff about how and whether theyll provide that information but i do think we need a clear look in the years that ive been on the council i think we get  weve made a lot of really good changes with how the budget is presented and one of them are the budget hearings i think theyre much more useful these days and much much more useful for the public who participates but to some extent we get less information in the budget its a little more challenging to go in and look department by department to see what kinds of   101348 am  programs are active programs that you know maybe the priorities have switched some of these programs have been going for decades and may no longer be the priorities if those are  i certainly wouldnt support people losing their jobs but there may be programs within different departments that we would rather stop and shift the money to wages and so this is really i guess a conversation that will have to   i mean its a little late in the budget to have this particular conversation but i think if we had more of that information in our budget without having to ask for it through the qa i think wed have a better understanding of where we want to shift priorities one of the things i do is i go into the budget qa i do a tremendous job of this go through the old budget qas just to see  i can tell you i have a short list of programs that i know we continue to fund year after year after year that are probably not having the impact that putting the dollars into   101449 am   wages will and so thats going to be kind of one of my key areas of focus and i invite those of you who i know do the same work to collaborate on that so thank you all for bringing this proposal forward and i do want to make sure that as were having these conversations were being really clear about what some of those tradeoffs are i know because homelessness was mentioned earlier and that is certainly an area that this council has prioritized its one my office has prioritized even longer than its been a council priority and its certainly been a priority for the community as well i just want to remind the public whos listening that were funding that additional 3000 its an additional 3000 its not 3000 a year its an additional 3000 a year that work is being funded through the american rescue plan act and it will not be impacted by the budgetary discussions that were having right now   mayor adler thank you council member renteria   renteria yeah mayor i have to say that we have failed we didnt build enough housing   101550 am  here we went through the whole process which was codenext and we just did not put it through we could not punch it through and were paying for it now people are moving out of austin they cannot afford to live here and these are your workers and theyre not going to come back to austin for now 15 an hour forget it thats why we have a shortage look at the lifeguards 500 signing bonus and we still cant get them why because they dont live here in austin anymore i was telling people  i said you know what youre going to be in a very bad situation if we dont build housing for our workforce people here in austin and theyve not going to come back youre fooling yourself you know if we did not commit ourselves to build the housing that we need my neighbor when she saw the   101653 am  appraisal it jumped 300000 shes not 65 you know where your school taxes get frozen shes talking about moving to mexico now you know because the taxes  i mean i bought a house down there and im only paying 36 a year on my property tax you can still buy an avocado there for 7 cents you can drive your car down there for 350 a gallon why are you  i mean these people are not going to come back were losing them and were going to have to pay a lot more for the service that you want if you want them to come back and take care of your libraries or your swimming pool guards i mean or you want them  your workers are not coming back i go to the restaurant now i have to wait 30 minutes more than i normally would to get service because i cannot find the employees there because   101754 am   theyre out round rock georgetown pflugerville theyre all in the same situation because they cannot afford to live in this area and the further you move working class people the more reluctant they are to come to austin and theyre going to find a job we flayed to be really serious about this we need to build housing and were talking about the 30 40 50 mfi people and if we dont build those homes youre going to have your labor force here arguing about 25 35 here in the next two three years   mayor adler yes council member fuentes and harpermadison   fuentes thank you i appreciate the conversation around housing i noticed in the 2015 memo from   101854 am  the previous working group that a housing study was cited as part of the recommendations it was based on the recommendations and we know that the average rent here in austin has gone up 32 to where its 1500 for a onebedroom so imagine someone who makes 45000 being able to afford an apartment  a onebedroom apartment at 1500 or being able to purchase a home at 550000 which was the average cited back in january so i did want to point out how important housing is as part of this conversation i also wanted to mention council member tovo you bring up some excellent points with understanding better the vacancy rate and having more information and so colleagues wanted to draw your attention to that on next weeks agenda we have an item that is specifically focused on raising the livable wage to 22 and getting us that information that many of us have cited wanting to have more of so perhaps you know we can  ill post in the message board   101954 am  we can coalesce our questions so that our hr team is able to provide that information as part of next weeks conversation and through the budget process i also wanted to know in the vacancy report that i received there is you know lots to dig through we have a position in the aviation department in 2017 that is paid at 117000 and its been vacant now for five years i think theres a lot for us to dig through when we look at lao can we best allocate our budget so were able to raise the livable wage at a substantial rate thank you   mayor adler okay council member harpermadison sorry hang on one second   tovo can i just ask a super quick question what vacancy report are you referring to   fuentes it is a  the budget team they have monthly vacancy reports and so we can share that  we can pass that around   tovo is that something that weve been receiving each month or is that something you specifically requested    102054 am   fuentes i specifically requested   we can send it to the entire council   tovo thank you and just as a matter of practice thats usually the way that works thanks   mayor adler council member harpermadison and council member kitchen   harpermadison thank you ill be brief most of us have mentioned that a plan moving forward is something that wed all like to see so id very much like to see in addition to just generally a plan how do we get to  that we need to be preparing for now to get us there in 2027   mayor adler council member kitchen   kitchen yes and just quick lip i want to mention also that im bringing an item for next week that relates specifically to the call takers and the situation with the pay i know our staffs been working very diligently as has the police chief on that issue   102155 am  i believe there may be some remaining issues so my intent is to bring in on the addendum for next week also and we can have that conversation also   mayor adler  indiscernible kitchen im sorry what   mayor adler next week   kitchen theres an issue related to the level of pay for call takers and theres a lot of complexities around it but it also relates to the vacancy rates the bottom line issue is what were experiencing with the 911 call center and the call takers and the difficulties that we have filling those positions and keeping our level of response at what it needs to be   mayor adler got it   kitchen so i just want to acknowledge that  i know the staffs been working on this at least as of today im not sure were all the way there so im going to put that on the general dumb and well see how much weve accomplished with what the staff has been able to   102255 am   doddendum and well see how much weve accomplished with what the staff has been able to do   mayor adler great thank you and i do note theres an item coming back up on the agenda i like as we have been doing holding your community accountable to the same standards we hold ourselves to so as we move our number up we need to make sure were using our buying power to encourage others to have others meet us i couldnt tell whether it would inadvertently have us if we dont get to 22 right away requiring the rest of the community get there before we do which i dont think was the intent but we can take a look at that so that were asking people to do everything we do but not beyond what we do   i believe director hayes had something to add   i just want to point out that the initial living wage committee came up with a fiveyear plan the one that would have resulted in 1683 what we would propose in the budget this year through the city manager would be also a   102356 am  fiveyear plan best practice would say after 5 to 7 years you do want to bring your community in to think about the unintended consequences in community and so that is intentional to bring them back and so the plan would be a fiveyear plan for you to see and create what that sustainable plan would look like and then we would then again bring the team back add new groups to have the discussion again to maintain the continuity of community input to the process   mayor adler thank you mayor pro tem   alter thank you i appreciate the conversation i wanted to ask i think this would be ms hayes if you could provide us with a memo that lists some of those other wage and benefit changes that we implemented so that we can have some greater transparency and clarity over those some were temporary some were longerterm but i think that would be helpful to have that broader picture as part of the   102457 am  background as were thinking about things thank you   mayor adler council member kitchen   mayor adler i also want to let people know that item 65 thats on this agenda this relates to power purchase agreements and it relates to something the mayor was referencing earlier which has to do with extending our benefits to contracts contracted workers i do support postponing that to next week the staff has asked me to postpone it to the 16th which i think makes sense because we can have that conversation as part of our other conversations so i will be proposing that we postpone it  now im doing that with the understanding  i know that theres been a request for an executive session on this issue so im doing this with the understanding that the executive session will occur on the 14th not the 16th   102558 am  because having the executive session on the 14th will allow for whatever conversation people wanted to have who asked for that executive session so we do that on the 14th and then we postpone the item from this thursday to the following thursday the 16th so thats what im proposing and i wanted to let people know that i  you know i am supporting postponing that agenda item   mayor adler looks like we can do it on the 14th i think the director may need to be with us   pool not available and her staff are out on the 14th but the outside council is also not available when i talked with the city manager and the general manager in order to find a date that would address everybodys needs we landed on the 16th i apologize to my colleague who is bringing this item that its not possible to do it on the 14th but that is actually the situation   102700 am   mayor adler okay   kitchen then i would like to explore having it on this thursday i dont think its fair to have it the same day that were trying to vote on it and i do not support postponing this past the 16th so well work offline to see if we can possibly do it this thursday i dont know what the reason was for asking for an executive session but its perfectly fine i respect peoples right to have that but i dont want it to push to the same day that we are going to take up to the item so lets explore what our options are   mayor adler okay council member tovo   tovo since its on this weeks agenda and we have an austin energy meeting so i assume our staff are able to participate in todays meeting i would also be interested in seeing whether its an option for today we could hear an executive session on today or thursday and at least get some sense of what the legal concerns that our colleagues have raised are so if thats an option for today that would be my request but i concur i just think we do better when   102802 am  we have information headed of time on some of these issues and i dont have a clear sense of  as a cosponsor i dont have a clear sense of what the legal concerns might be    mayor adler can you check on that   i dont think were prepared to do it today but we can look for thursday   kitchen okay that will be fine   tovo is it possible to hear from our colleagues what their league questions are in an executive session without having a presentation from our staff   pool if i could interject i would like to hear from the general manager because shes the one and her staff who are preparing the presentation including the legal ramifications and to fast forward this to thursday is not what i had posted on the message board i was very clear on the june 16 executive session i recognize your interest council member tovo and council member kitchen but as the chair of the austin   102903 am  energy oversight committee i have made  taken specific steps and had numerous conversations with our staff to align it all up in order to present the information that is necessary to have in fact in executive session and then there will be time that day to take up the item which is when it is i had proposed it and i had general agreement on the message board from this from the dais   tovo well to be clear   mayor adler    mayor adler hang on a second council member kitchen   kitchen as the sponsor of this item i have no idea what the legal questions are i have also been talking  you know ive also been talking with the with the general manager as i always would before i would bring anything like that and i agreed with her to postpone it based on the fact that we would have the conversation in the executive session in a timely way so that we would not be postponing it   103004 am  past the 16th so i dont see what the problem is about going back and asking her if shes available on thursday its posted for thursday i had originally asked her to do it today but then i  you know it was never explained to me and there was never any conversation   mayor adler lets do this lets post it for executive session on thursday at the very least i think its reasonable to say lets identify the issues so if we have people that have asked for that they can let us all know why it is that theyve asked for it so at the very least we have that information before the week is over council member tovo    tovo and maybe we have that   thank you i think thats responsive to the fact that cosponsors that council member kitchen has brought this forward and there are cosponsors who put it on this weeks agenda can you help me understand who requested the executive session were there colleagues who requested it or was it a request of the staff   103105 am   mayor adler the chair of the austin energy requested it   tovo okay thank you   mayor adler so well put it on executive session on thursday at the very least we can elevate at the very least the legal issues that are being looked at   pool im fine with doing that as far as elevating the questions i think we need to be aware that the elevation of the issues will then give our staff some time in order to be able to answer   mayor adler correct correct two weeks in a row   pool executive session agenda   mayor adler thats correct   kitchen wait just a minute i think what i heard mayor it sounds great what youre saying is were going to have executive session on the 14th we will if the general manager is available at the minimum well identify what the issues are   mayor adler were going to have it on executive session on june 9th   103205 am  this thursday   kitchen im sorry   mayor adler and then we will have it again on the 16th   kitchen yeah i would just ask  i know the general manager is prepared ive had a lot of conversations and i had a lot of conversations with her before i brought this item so i know shes  as long as shes available on the 9th i know that she would  shes prepared to address them so lets just check her availability for the 9th as well at a minimum we can raise the issues   mayor adler thats why i said at a minimum    kitchen okay   mayor adler were just going to call the item up   renteria mayor point of order are we still on the hearing here   mayor adler were trying to thank you council member   kitchen okay i think i understand   mayor adler all right i think were done thank you very much for being with us here today all right its 1030 lets see if we can get through some of the pulled items tee them up for conversation   103305 am   tovo mayor ill just reiterate while were shifting into our next subject that i do   i continue to believe that we need to look at our youth wages weve had some conversations via text back and forth about some of our staff back and forth we are not keeping up as i mentioned in our last council meeting talking about wages our youth programs our youth programs  our summer youth programs pay 8 an hour if we want to really attract a diverse broad group of young people to work here at the city for the summer i think we need to be able to compete with some of the other jobs that will otherwise provide more financial compensation so again just a headsup that im having those conversations and hope that we can get to a different path   mayor adler that sounds good and i look forward to seeing the numbers so i can see what it is that we can do and accomplish in this area all right colleagues lets go to some of the pulled   103408 am  items item number 61 was an item that i pulled im in favor of moving forward with this item i have some questions with respect to the greenfield section its one that we really have to make sure that we hit well if we do greenfield in a way that  we have to be careful that we dont do greenfield in a way that just makes it so that we preserve what it is thats existing out there for example in the sos areas we have large tracks  im sorry large tracks that are just paved over 100 the greenfield handled by itself require use of a lot of land for purposes that will ultimately   103508 am  mean i fear that none of those tracks will ever redevelop which is absolutely the opposite of what we want done so i think we need to take a look at the things that were associated with the original work  that the staff had done both environmental and beyond to make sure that were providing the incentive or the opportunity for people to actually take advantage and use those environmental sections so ill probably have an amendment that looks at that to make sure that the greenfield benefit actually gets utilized in the community   tovo would you mind  what clause are you concerned about   mayor adler my understanding is that the ifc as it moves forward talks about various aspects of the environmental work so i dont know which line it is   103612 am  on that but my understanding is that this ifc includes in it moving forward with the greenfield provisions that were part of the environmental work that was teed up for us to consider i think for some of the organizations its one of the real high priorities   tovo so the resolution is doing quite a few different things identified as priorities for a long while im not entirely sure what you mean by greenfield   mayor adler its the one  item number 6 on page 6   its online 136   mayor adler line 136 there it is its the ones  like track corner of 171 in lion oak hill   103712 am  which is an area thats 100 impervious cover the question is how do we encourage a redevelopment on that track in a way that actually  the green field rules say if you redevelop one of those tracks you have to come into present day standards its not the existing rules so thats a change but to take a track like that and come into standards means that a significant part of that property is going to have to be put to those new existing standards the concern was if we did that alone no one would ever redevelop any of those tracks   tovo okay thank you for that i look forward to seeing your amendment and to hearing from our city staff about what the recommendation is on that   mayor adler and basically just asking staff for recommendations on how to do that in a way that ensures that the greenfield standards would actually be used   tovo currently it says   103815 am   require new and developed  to use as a baseline when calculating drainage requirements and your intent is to bring an amendment that asks for staff to provide us with recommendations for how that could be achieved while ensuring that those sites with 100 impervious cover have an opportunity to redevelop okay   mayor adler correct   tovo all right thank you   mayor adler that was the only reason i pulled that item anybody have anything else on item 61 council member ellis   ellis not a question necessarily but i just appreciate the conversation because i know that area not only is extremely environmentally sensitive but also does have those full endtoend parking lots that were paved before the sos took place so were looking for creative ways to make sure that as things redevelop theyre redeveloped in an environmentally responsible way and you know that people are coming back to the city for instance for rezoning that were making sure that we get the best community benefit and environmental   103915 am  protection possible thank you for looking into that mayor   mayor adler anything else on this item council member vela   vela i do support the proposal i support environmentally strong standards my only concern with it similar to the mayors is that there are no impacts on overall housing costs thats another issue that has been brought to my attention and if we are going to implement a stricter standards with regard to water shed and environmental protection i just think its important to balance that out with additional entitlements for those same properties that are going up so that the overall effect is zero on the housing costs just given our housing situation at this time right   104017 am  now i cannot support additional costs  any additional costs on housing weve got to stop the housing cost increases   mayor adler i support you on that but i think its something we can do i think these environmental organizations moving forward are really important making sure were doing them in a way that still allows for the housing supply and the like and items are important so we do need to take a look at that    tovo and ill just call your attention mayor as the sponsor of this i appreciate the opportunity to provide a response to council member vela the last be it further addresses providing that information about whether there is any impact but understanding that there are also costs when we dont address these issues in our development and we dont ask developments to guard against things like flooding there is an impact that accrues to everybody who is part of the system and paying  you know whether theyre paying costs through their austin water bill   104118 am  or through other kinds of paying for the infrastructure that has to come in and clean up some of those issues so i think there are costs on either side but in any case the last be it further resolved addresses that need for additional information and thanks to council member renteria for providing some of the wording for that   vela thank you and i completely agree i know waller creek in my district in particular is in very bad shape some of my favorite moments in austin has been swimming in barton creek with my kids and my family and thats a unique pleasure to be able to enjoy and urban water shed like that i completely support moving forward with stricter environment regulations i do appreciate that that resolution is in there   tovo waller creek runs through my district as well and theres a real concrete example   104218 am  of how flooding has impacted housing there because theres significant flooding in one area of hyde park and the staff have mitigated it by buying some land from the alamo draft house the old baker school in hyde park the property that the alamo bought one of their proposals was to construct housing in back portion of it the city of austin had to require a piece of it to use for   let me not use the right term but to help mitigate flooding in that neighborhood and so what had been intended for affordable housing is now part of our flooding solutions for that area so when we dont consider these   when we dont have these as important considerations at the outset it has impacts that are real that are financial that are sometimes going to impact where and how we can do other kinds of housing   104322 am    i wanted to thank council member tovo and staff for working really hard to put together this resolution in a really thorough way i think is going to have really important seeds for protecting our community and our environment for decades to come so thank you pleased to be added as a cosponsor   mayor adler council member tovo i appreciate you adding  that was the section i was looking at that asks for the analysis on the impact of affordability impact analysis i hear council member vela also suggesting in addition to that to the degree that there are impacts that we ask staff to tell us how we can mitigate that how we can still achieve the environmental protections that are envisioned by those ordinances and do it in a way that still has the least impact on housing supply and many other   104422 am  things that you mentioned that is the language that im taking a look at to have that also part of that sentiment   tovo so thats the same kind of thing asking staff at that section as well to provide recommendations and if there are impacts on costs to provide recommendations for mitigating those impacts   mayor adler cost or supply but yes recommendations that would mitigate them so that we can achieve them both   tovo thank you   mayor adler council member kitchen   kitchen i want to thank council member tovo for all the work that her staffs been doing on this and bringing this forward its a way to also bring forward some actions that the council has taken in the past including some actions that we did take around the land development code previously in recognizing the importance of updating a number of these areas its very timely for us to be   104523 am  addressing this right now i appreciate the conversation everyone is having i dont think we need to be in a situation where we have to choose between housing and environment i think it goes together appreciate council member tovo the language that youre talking about which will get us the information back from staff about how we both mitigate and how we address the kind of issues that you raise thank you for bringing it in that way   mayor adler my staff has touched base with me and made sure that im not limiting myself just to the language in lines 163 the more appropriate place im being told might be in the  in or about the line 150 but it is to express that same sentiment im not sure of the appropriate place    tovo okay   104624 am  just to be clear 150 talks about my expectation or our expectation those of the sponsors that were going to begin with the code amendments that were part of the land development code because basically weve given them a short timeframe the reason why is that theyre already crafted thanks to council member kitchens direction and other directions of previous resolutions well look at your amendments when they come forward   mayor adler and i think council member tovo that a lot of the things that i understand council member vela asking to look at were also part of that same address on the land development code i dont think its necessarily reinventing the wheel on those things i think thats what was envisioned back then doing things to enable and to make sure that we were in fact getting these environmental advancements in place and that   104725 am  people would use them without a corresponding impact on housing supplier costs we will try to work on a language and post council member kitchen   kitchen i just wanted to emphasize that we have  we can certainly have the conversation again im not saying we cant i just wanted to remind folks that we had a lot of these conversations a good part of these recommendations we already passed and we passed them in the context of the balancing and mitigation conversations that we had so if theres other specific things that people feel like were not addressing id love to hear what those are so i look forward to the conversation when we get down to the specifics   mayor adler and i think thats right earlier it was a broader conversation environmental protections and advancements in context of a larger work this is bringing forth the environmental protection component of that and what were asking is  we also take   104825 am  a look at those things that were part in parcel of this in that larger conversation that we should also pull together to help ensure that were not having an adverse effect on supply and the like   kitchen and i get that just wanting to understand what those are we are also making some progress on the other thing we still have a lot more to do just conversations is not specific it doesnt  help me understand about what were trying to balance i think we have proved all those things too these are all things i think that were all approved as part of those conversations that we were having   kitchen okay   mayor adler okay lets go on to the next pulled item next pulled item item number 62 this is the adu ifc mayor pro tem you pulled this one   alter yes thank you i wanted to ask the sponsor some questions and then after ive asked the sponsors i wanted to invite staff up   104928 am  i think its really an opportunity for us to look at ads and see how we can make them more  make it easier for folks to build them cosponsor several resolutions that were moving in this direction many of them led by council member tovo i do think though its important for openness and transparency that we be really clear about what this resolution would be asking staff to do i think theres a lot of terms in here and i dont think its readily apparent to the community what the import is so the first thing that i wanted to ask and i think council member kelly you were the sponsor is what does it mean to regulate  i have my view of what it means but i want to make sure that were all on the same page what does it mean to regulate ads as an accessory use to a primary residential use   105032 am   kelly thanks for asking that my staff and council harpermadisons staff also went back and forth with the city legal department quite a bit on this because it doesnt initiate code changes so a lot of those terms in the resolution are very legalesque i guess which doesnt help with a layperson so i help you raising this   i appreciate you raising this when you have a primary residence where you spend your time an accessory use would be for a secondary type location where an adu is in the backyard so you could have your family back there or you could take care of your grandmother and have them close by   alter so this doesnt tell me what this changes in the code   could we pull city staff up to explain it in more detail thank you   105135 am   alter mr floyd if you could answer what that means in terms of a code amendment change    sure dsd development officer the way we interpret that language is basically just to give a little context adus are currently  type of adu that people use the most called two family residential use its not even called adu in the code and its built into the principal use regulations but we also have other types of ads that are all subject to being significantly changed based on the december resolution from last year things like guest houses and onsite worker housing and those are codified in the general accessory use provisions of the code and the way we interpret this resolution direction would be to basically pick a lane not have them scattered what it would do is basically   105236 am  consolidate the regulations within the actual accessory use provisions of the code and we think that makes sense in terms of putting them all in one place and having the regulations easier to administer and easier to locate in terms of the substantive impact either route is fine as we craft our proposal and begin taking it through the process well work with the law department and hpd but we think that any of councils policy goals with respect to adus can be affectuated wherever theyre in code if you want to switch lanes and go back to the principal use approach youll be able to do that so were committed to delivering council substantive set of amendments that do the things laid out in your december resolution as well as your current resolution in this particular direction provides   105337 am  guidance as to kind of where in the code theyre going to go and how the regulations are going to be expressed   alter is there a substantive impact though to where you are allowed to build an adu because we currently have areas where youre not allowed to build an adu   councils direction from december the resolution from december provides guidance as to for example looking at sf 1 and sf 2 all of that can be effectuated through the vehicle that were talking about now consolidated the regulations in the accessory use provisions so we will work with the law department and hpd to craft appropriate amendments but i think councils direction can be achieved within the accessory use part of the code   105437 am   one of the things ive identified with ads is it doesnt feel like its a very streamlined process theres a lot of different moving parts and so by moving it into that type of area it will be a lot more streamlined    alter and i guess im not concerned about streamlining i dont know that im necessarily concerned about the changes for the ads i just want to make sure i understand what this is directing and how it relates to our previous resolution which i didnt have in my backup this resolution i found confusing because i was like we already did x y and z and then there are pieces of it that seem to do other things but i dont know what those mean substantively i want to understand what we are substantively saying beyond a cosmetic of where you put this   105538 am  in  where you put it in the code since it was your resolution and i have some other  tovo i have the same questions i would ask that the last resolution be put in the backup as youre answering my colleagues questions if you could explain how this code amendment differs because we asked for  i understand that work is in progress we asked you to streamline the different kinds of accessory dwellings and the different kinds of second family im not clear on how this differs if you could address that   sure so i think the first resolution from december it initiated some amendments but it appeared to leave other things out of the actual initiation and simply wanted a staff   105643 am  recommendation it provides specific guidance on what the form of the regulations take it provides guidances to how theyll be streamlined and where in the code theyll go which is kind of the  asked for a recommendation and didnt include that in the initiated amendments so when we look at these together this second resolution i think provides firmer guidance it would affect the way amendments are provided if you want to go back to the principal use path where two family residential use is currently regulated in the code it wont be hard to reformat the amendments in that manner so basically the amendments that we would bring through the public process would be sort of codified generally in the family   105744 am  of code sections thats around 252893 in that area of the code we would provide all the council provided in december the preservation bonus all of those substantive provision we would find a way to fold in through that context   kitchen so i think what i hear you saying is the first be it resolved is about structure of the actual code it is not a substantive change its about structure of the code and i hear mayor pro tem perhaps  asking what does this do in terms of substance you need to look at the rest of the be it resolves for some of the substance changes   105851 am  if you look at some of the other ones there are changes related to parking there are changes related to providing flexibility for where on a lot you locate an adu i heard your broader question which i thought i heard as trying to figure out what this does you cant just look at the first be it resolved to ask what the substance changes are so thats my comment i think its useful to provide all of these changes substance changes as well as the first changes which really just goes back to putting it all together in the same place so we can see it more readily instead of pick and choose which is one of the problems with the existing land development code   mayor adler mayor pro tem   alter again i do not like to vote on things when i do not understand what they do   105953 am  i hear what youre saying that this is a change to structure i guess what im trying to understand is once you make it an accessory use doesnt that then apply to every residence regardless of the other  i mean we have the other direction which i support and im not saying i dont support this i just want to make sure im understanding what its doing and im not sure that it is strictly a structural formatting thing and i think we have to be transparent about what we are asking for   so i think  let me try to address what may be one of your concerns under the current general accessory use provisions for example the guest house thats in that provision that would not trigger any parking requirements and we know that thats not councils intent with regard to ads youre clear on what the parking reductions are in the   110053 am  resolution were clear on what the current parking requirements are for the twofamily residential use type of ads so we would in crafting the amendments make sure we make the necessary changes to implement that there are differences that council desires with respect to the types of ads that would be allowed in different zoning districts and so that can also be crafted into the accessory use the general accessory use provision so we would make sure in working again with a law department and with hpd to craft the amendments in a way that adheres to the fairly specific direction that council provided in the december resolution    alter so youre saying in making the accessory use you can still differentiate in any way that we wanted to differentiate by moving it there simply thats not making a determination on where its   110154 am  allowed and again im not saying i dont want it in more places i just want to understand what this is doing   no we would craft the amendments in a way where the development  that those would all be crafted according to councils direction which does vary based on zoning districts so we would work with law and with hpd and we would craft amendments that adhere to that and there are other places within the broad accessory use parts of the code where there is some variation based on zoning district so that would not be unique to this we would work to flesh that out i dont think it would have any unintended consequences council member alter   alter okay so in consolidating things you would still be able to differentiate however a policy evolves its just placing it in one place so if somebody says i want to build an adu and no matter where they are they just go to   110255 am  the one place instead of having to look in multiple places   absolutely   alter okay thank you i appreciate that clarity and then what does the secondtolast be it resolved actually do it says the city council initiates amendments to city code title 25 to provide for limited modifications to regulations to facilitate construction of ads on lots where strict application of title 25 would prohibit adu construction such modifications would not  may provide flexibility for locating an adu in buildable areas of a lot council member kelly   kelly thank you erica is on the line from our legal department and i believe she can speak to that as well   good morning mayor and council erica lopez assistant city attorney i believe the intent of that language was as theres multiple   110358 am   regulations that come into play with an adu for example there may be compliance with a setback compliance there might be a heritage tree that is impacting the area that could be buildable i think this was trying to see if there was some places in code where there could be built in an administrative process where there could be some limited relief from that that takes place on an individual kind of scale to allow for the actual construction of an adu so if you applied all the regulations cumulatively that would result in the adu not being able to be constructed so this would be kind of tasking staff with the direction to look for areas where some modification would be appropriate and i think it   110500 am  would just be very limited and i think brent could elaborate on what he envisions in that   ellis thank you erica   so during the code rewrite process there were various instructions from council which staff wasnt always able to implement because these are tricky issues but there was various directions to try to prioritize regulations and provide for  if you have a situation where as erica described where there are ways we could administratively build in certain relief valves that would help allow the desired use and an example might be for instance somebody has a lot within a zoning district where you can do an adu its a big enough lot there arent any impervious cover issues but theres an austin energy easement that prohibits the location of an adu or theres the critical root zone for a heritage tree would there be a way to build into the regulations some limited allowance to move into the setback a little bit   110601 am  would there be a way to build into the regulations a limited allowance to exceed mcmansion a little bit to the minimum extent that that would be necessary to allow an adu without hurting the heritage tree we wouldnt ever bring  without specific direction we would not bring council an ordinance that varies there to tree regulations and obviously austin energy has its easement so we wouldnt be messing with that but we would look for ways to provide releech that would allow the location of the adu within a buildable area one of the guiding considerations i think would have to be can we really define these circumstances with precise lairty we dont want staff in a situation where theyre essentially granting a boa variance based on subjective requirements so i think for those reasons as erica said whatever we would bring council in response to   110702 am  this would be very limited and might not do everything that the people would like those are the types of scenarios that we would evaluate and see if we could come up with something that would help  facilitate ads in those cases where as erica said the cumulative regulations on particular lots have the effect of not allowing them   alter okay so what would come back to us would be actually very specific its not a process where then there would be rules that would be separate from council approval   one of the things that we would look at is whether there would be a possibility for giving the boa some sort of additional authority with respect to ads so that would be something we would look at but with regard to the administrative side it would be a very clearly defined set of regulations that define the   110803 am  circumstances in which one regulation is varied a little bit because its impossible otherwise to locate an adu on a property that otherwise is in title i we would leave impervious cover alone we wouldnt modify lot size and we wouldnt  nor again would we modify the heritage tree regulations but we would look for circumstances where if a critical root zone prohibits an adu are there ways that we could locate the adu elsewhere on the lot so those are the types of scenarios we would look at there are difficult issues to address so again i think whatever we would bring council would be fairly limited in scope and we would make sure that its very clearly described and defined   alter thank you i appreciate that obviously there are challenges and everyone on the dais has said that theyre committed to   110904 am  allowing for additional ads and weve taken steps with the goal of making them easier all of which are not yet available for us to vote on so im going to think about that and see if i have any amendments to that piece there for added clarity i do want to flag that i will likely have an amendment related to ads and utility regulations weve been seeing that a lot lately and i think we need to have some better mechanisms related to that so dont know exactly what thats going to look like yet but i just wanted to flag that   kelly could you circulate that before thursdays meeting   alter i will circulate that as soon as i get it i dont know exactly when i will thank you   mayor adler kathie   tovo thanks for the questions and conversation so far so i think i want to understand from staff and then also from you council member kelly whether its also  whether    111004 am  yalls understanding is the same so back in december we had two resolutions i would ask our staff to put both of those in backup the previous ones the ones that i brought forward with colleagues in december initiated multiple things including an amendment to city code would allow internal or external ads and in the course of constructing it it would ask for options for scaling the size of ads based on lot size restricting ads as a shortterm rental various other things it asked for options about a streamlined definition of accessory dwelling unit that eliminates the distinctions among the different types of the code i did not understand that you didnt understand that that was to be part of the code amendment thats interesting information did you get back to us with those recommendations   111105 am   we have not we certainly can do that one of the  im glad to get this clarity on the record we had interpreted the recent direction with regard to sort of codifying ads as an accessory use as sort of essentially directing us to include that within the code amendment so the revised definitions and all of that would come forward as a package with a substantive amendments in the code amendments that go forward but council member tovo if you would like the recommendation with regard to the definition to come separately as a recommendation we can certainly do that as well   tovo i was just asking because it sounded like in your answer to the mayor pro tem that you were not working on this piece because there wasnt clarity about which we wanted to initiate and i was just simply pointing out that we asked for you to return with those recommendations for a streamlined definition including external and internal units and also for removing   111207 am  requirements related to age ability occupation or family status by february 1 so yes providing information about how the different  how the different amendment options would impact  how they would kind of total out based on different kinds of zone properties so you clarified with me that we didnt get that information so how does  i think im still confused about how these work together because we initiated that work it was my understanding from my staffs conversations with you that that work is you should way that its coming forward and so i think i understood from what you were saying that this sort of answers the question that we asked you to provide an answer to that we asked you to provide recommendations for streamlined definition were going to skip over  if this passes were going to skip over that and provide them as an   111308 am   accessory by dealing with it as an accessory i guess i share the same question the mayor pro tem does im not understanding the distinction but i guess i would ask my colleague council member kelly what do you see as the advantage of having it be an accessory use versus seeing what the other options are   kelly having them in the code together like what staff has explained to us is helpful especially in the community had when theyre trying to figure out where to look i can tell you the land development code is not something im an expert in and even digging into this and to be complementary to what you did in december was a difficult task and i know that councilmember harpermadisons office safetied us with with the code as complicated as it is i think putting it in one place instead of different places is helpful to not just us as council members but to community as well   tovo sure i completely agree i dont think theres anything in the work that preclude it had it from being in the same spot i dont think we ever talked   111411 am  about it i think thats great what do you see the advantage of having it under accessory use under the code im just wondering what kind of conversations you had that led you to put it right there   kelly yeah erica do you want to explain how we came to that conclusion i think it would be more impactful since we discussed that together if you talked about it   um im sorry erica lopez assistant city attorney i think there were kind of multiple places in the code that talk about accessory dwelling units and as an accessory use if theres already a principal use there seemed to be two types of ads already authorized under accessory uses so i think that that was the  that was a place   111515 am  where it could easily be put in to the code and there might be different regulations that apply i think that it is my understanding that the intent of this is to allow the construction of more adus in more districts and so this was a place in the code where it was kind of based on the principal use and maybe not necessarily the zoning district   tovo i see so what we had initiated did extend ads to sf 1 and sf 2 im not sure i could answer that question about whether that broadens it or not but it sounds like youre suggesting it does broaden it to different zoning categories that were not contemplated in the first resolution maybe thats a question that we need to take up between    111615 am  here and thursday im not understanding    kelly if we could let staff speak to that   so councilmember tovo just a couple of things im sorry for the confusion if any of the confusion is deriving from my comments i apologize for that but we would in crafting the amendments if theyre put in accessory use part of the code we would absolutely adhere to the direction with regard to the differences between zoning districts this would simply be consolidating the regulations into a single part of the code and we would make sure that all the other council direction which were very aware of from the december resolution is adhered to and that would involve rewriting those sections which is on the table anyway youve given us direction appropriately with regard to the onsite work housing guest housing all that stuff so those sections are going to be recrafted in the amendments that we bring   111718 am  you with regard to the stream lyoned definition we had some delay in putting together this ordinance as we waited for and worked with law to process kind of the acuna ruling but we have the material for a streamlined definition that we could bring you through a memo fairly quickly if you would like us to do that when we saw this resolution we thought it may be desirable rather than to have a recommendation come forward separate from the amendments to just bring it all forward as part of a proposed ordinance councilmember tovo we can certainly provide you a sort of draft a memo that walks through some recommendations and we can do that very quickly   ill think about it between here and thursday i mean this is on todays agenda and not to be rude about it but the work was requested back in february i dont know if this resolution has been in progress since then but im  i dont know whether it makes sense to have the   111818 am  streamlined definition come forward or not at this point i know when we requested is this indiscernible the code amendments were in progress so im just trying to understand the order of things here so i think what id like  so i think what i hear you saying brent is that this resolution builds on it does not reverse course from the resolution that weve already passed   absolutely not   tovo so councilmember kelly i want to be sure that since youre bringing this forward its not a staff recommendation though it sounds like it has some clear elements that the staff have identified is that  your intent as well so for example when we when we initiated the code amendments it was to broad ebb the use of ads along with and tied to the preservation of an existing singlefamily dwelling is that your intent   kelly what i want you to know real quick before i answer that im other is   111919 am  im not trying to step on your toes or undo any of the work that you or the rest of the council has done if anything my purpose in this resolution specifically is to add more fall to our adu policy as a whole and to daylight issues that i think that we could really address and change positively for the city i want to increase housing and i am to remove barriers to housing and i want the resolution to complement yours i dont want to undo anything that youve worked so hard on and i can tell that you have some frustration that some of the things youve asked for have not come forward and im not trying to make things worse by bringing this forward i want you to know that   tovo sure and i appreciate your whole interest which i think the whole council shares that were making adus more available throughout the city so i am simply trying to  its great to have more people involved in this work im simply trying to understand because its been in progress for awhile i want to make sure that they are working hand in hand and   112022 am  sometimes it runs off schedule so i dont fault staff for not having it finished i know its coming forward andrew rivera in a good pace i know our staff are working closely as i understand with preservation austin which have looked at other cities to really craft that preservation piece of it i really want to be sure that your understanding is the same as staff that this is going to build on and have those other provisions as it moves forward   kelly absolutely this took several months for my staff and councilmember harpermadisons staff to figure out and it looks much better than how it started because we included staff and legal in our conversations and had several meetings to ensure that our intent which is to streamline ads and to remove some of the requirements there to be sure that theyre available to more people at a lower cost was achieved and we believe weve achieved that but for the general public im glad that mayor pro tem brought it up it is hard to understand what the resolution means which is why ive leaned   112122 am  heavily on staff to show you all that we have had these discussions and that is what our intent is    tovo so it is your intent to build on the kinds of criteria that were set in the previous one   kelly absolutely   tovo im still a little confused about the accessory but ill go back to that passage of code and    kitchen mayor   mayor adler hang on councilmember ellis will be next   tovo i think it was erica and brent both kind of described what kinds of  you offered some example erica in particular of the kinds of modifications that might be included in that second to last be it further resolved to craft an adu and i wanted to ask councilmember kelly do you envision  the examples were what i would regard as minor modifications did you have a discussion with the staff about critical environmental features and where those might fit into this   112224 am  would you regard those as minor modifications or would critical environmental features not be one of the things that is modified around   kelly i believe we need to pay attention to environmental features and that is something that the staff will take into consideration when they come back to us with recommendations my thoughts specifically about that part of the resolution were things like a second water meter being required if its a  for me i could see justification of if its a whole family and grandma lives in the back in an adu that you dont have a second water meter because youre billing for the same household making that optional is something that i saw that could be removed as a barrier theres significant costs associated with that when it comes to the environment and the environment is important and we need to protect that but some of those limited modifications that staff had recommended could come back to us as a possibility were speaking theoretically here are important for us to   112325 am  consider and understand and have discussions about   tovo okay i guess well see what those modifications are but i wanted to get a sense of what kind of modifications you were directing it was my understanding and maybe we need to get clarity that a second water meter was no longer required i thought we were talking about this section more about physical  modifications based on the physical landscape of the site   to me thats actually on the building so its physical i apologize for the miss interpretation   tovo its a question that comes up all the time but i thought our water utility had addressed it maybe its some clarity that we can get by thursday thank you very much    mayor adler thank you councilmember ellis   ellis thank you mayor i remember this language coming up when we were doing the land development code revision about some of the setback issues and being able to preserve the trees and having a little bit of wiggle room with those setbacks so in my opinion this predates councilmember kellys time on the dais but shes come up with a   112425 am  creative solution that yes has been discussed before but thats what part of collaboration is about is we can have these conversations again and again and still keep trying to solve the problems i appreciate her office and councilmember harpermadisons office working so diligently on this i know this was something in years past that ive thought about and we get to be here again to vote on this this week to address the situation you know this to me is not a conversation where just because weve passed a resolution doesnt mean we cant continue to think about doing this work or think about it from different angles on different timelines because its important that people know what they can and cannot do with the property that they own you shouldnt have to hire a lobbyist just because you want to build an accessory dwelling unit i cant wait to iron out some of the details and see what comes back from the resolution that we passed in december i think that councilmember kelly has been really  indiscernible with this and i appreciate her asking me to cosponsor i look forward to supporting   112526 am  this on thursday tells thank you councilmember ellis   mayor adler council member vela and councilmember kitchen   vela i want to thank councilmember kelly for bringing forward the resolution my wife and i just recently built an adu in our house and it went well everything is fine but it is an unnecessarily complicated process and to the extent that we can streamline it and reduce the costs involved for a family that wants to build an adu we should absolutely do that i think this resolution goes in that direction and i look forward to seeing staff come back to it later   mayor adler thank you councilmember harpermadison   harpermadison thank you mayor i agree ultimately i think that mr loy i cant you said something earlier that i think appropriately   112626 am   articulated it you said this would make it easier to register and administrate and consolidate the regulations which i think is important and one of my staffers pointed out that two of the goals of imagine austin say that the land development code should achieve two of the bullets ensure the delivery of efficient services and provide clear guidance in a user friendly format so thats why i was so happy to be a part of this discussion process because i do think its complementary i dont think that one takes away from the other i do appreciate that the way staff sees it is that you get clear guidance and dont necessarily have to come back to council for additional direction this feels like its putting it in a box that you can very easily find a solution one of the things i want to say and this may or may not be the time or day to say it but one of the things i would like to point out is i appreciate you offering me gratitude but its not me its lauren harding in my   112727 am  office who gets the credit this is one of the times that we really recognize how much we lean on our staff and their various degrees of subject matter expertise which so happens that shes done this and has been a part of this process and discussion for long enough where she has real clear insight and knowledge which is very important i think we should probably do a proclamation for council staffers at some point to just really acknowledge how much we appreciate them and the work that they provide for us so thank you councilmember kelly for bringing this item forward i think ads really do provide opportunities for smaller less expensive homes and neighborhoods that are otherwise filled withstand alone houses i think it would be the only way our family is able to pay the taxes on the expensive teenytiny house that we bought in central east austin i think one of the terms we hear in this housing discussion is gentle density and in my mind ads really   112827 am  do represent that gentle density im happy that were building on the work that councilmember tovos office brought forward with the previous resolution i think ads are compact on average we use 40 energy than a single detached home thats equivalent to taking nearly 100 cars off the road a year and caleb in my office is certainly a part of bringing that talking point forward i appreciate that you put it in its own lane if for some other reason these conversations were having around housing and mobility are directly connected that i appreciate that you inadvertently connected the two doing that i think would help offset homeowners rising costs we spoke about that earlier today anything and everything that were able to do to offset the costs is important it fulfills some of our imagine austin goals in addition to making things simpler and making it easier for hour constituents to consume i think it also says that   112929 am   our land development code should be efficient and should provide clear guidance in a user friendly format i think we spoke to that earlier about transparency with the budget everybodys got to be able to do this lay people included relatively new council members included we should all be able to be a part of the conversation regardless of where we are in the conversation just entering it or been here talking about it for 10 years i think we should all  the baseline should be similar and accessible ilike how the resolution really does build upon councilmember tovos december direction and gives staff more flexibility thats what i heard you and our assistant city attorney say more flexibility both to be creative and to come back to us with the best adu ordinance that they can come up with for us to consider at a future date i want to be sure to reiterate how much we truly do rely on the subject matter expertise of our staffers and just again just   113031 am  say a deep grateful thanks to all the staff members both for council and otherwise that had to go through multiple iteration for months to really figure out exactly how to best articulate the information that got brought forward today thank you everybody who worked so hard to bring it forward   mayor adler councilmember kitchen   kitchen i just wanted to say that i also appreciate this resolution as well as the previous one that we passed back in november because im looking forward to making significant changes to ads i want to say thank you to councilmember kelly for bringing this forward i think it builds on as r as others have said the other thing that might be helpful brent is i took a look at  we had a lot of questions and i did too before i signed on to cosponsor and i appreciate being a cosponsor   113133 am  the language talks about one specific question 252893 so for my colleagues who are asking questions about that aspect of it if you just look at that section its just a list its just a list of the different things that can be considered accessory uses and it has a couple of those in the list that relate to ads so it makes sense as a place to consolidate what might be helpful i think to answer folkss questions is to indicate whether that term putting it in this section and i know you guys will know this already and be careful as you write into it but whether that term as an accessory use is someplace else in the code also that might inadvertently attach something to it that was not intended i know you probably already know that because you probably know the land development code code like the back of your hand but in any case if you can point   113234 am   out to other folks as youre going through this if that term is used in other parts of the code that might be helpful   kelly council member i know that erica and the law department really looked at the code and she might be able to speak to that now if there are any conflicts i believe they identified every place in the code according to what our intent was with this resolution so that there wouldnt be any conflicts   kitchen i trust law to have already done that im saying for my colleagues asking questions about that it might be helpful provide that information   kelly gotcha   mayor adler sounds good i appreciate this resolution its good adus is something that there have been numerous resolutions on this through the years and we continue to hone it and make it better every time i think collectively everybody feels like weve all been working on this and i think the product represents that kind of collective work so i appreciate this i think though it is   113334 am  timely to catch up on the resolution that came from councilmember tovo last year because we had thought we would be further along that in this point too so if this can help bring that forward that would be great   just to clarify for council at the committee meeting the housing and planning committee meeting councilmember tovo i think mentioned that she expected the ordinance would be coming forward in the fall the code amendments and that is definitely our plan so we are on track to do that and if council would like a memo in advance of that that kind of walks through the ideas for a streamlined definition we can certainly do that as well i do think that the currently proposed resolution that is supplemental to the december resolution provides direction where we can consolidate all of those recommendations into the proposed ordinance that would go through the public process and come to council in the fall but were certainly  our work is well advanced   113435 am  multiple staff from different departments have been working on this and so were certainly happy to provide a preview memo on some of the high level issues or just bring it all forward as a consolidated proposal in the fall   mayor adler so this is like the third or fourth time you have made that offer so now im going to accept that offer because it sounds as if the works been done and it wont be a lot of work to generate that kind of interim report and because we dont want to take you off  there are so many things on your plate right now residential and commercial area well be passing this week further things with the compatibility ordinance as long as it doesnt slow down that work if you advance the work if you could  give us a brief highlight of where you guys are that would always be nice thank you anybody else have anything else on this kathie   tovo yeah i think i would underscore that point at this point if weve now  if youre no progress   113535 am  with the resolution  i dont know about the memo i guess at this point if its going to slow down the work but i think were going to need to see different options for it before we pass the code amendment so that was the intent of trying to get that information out im not sure that this  i dont think that first passage resolves those questions i know we sort of started our conversation there but i dont think putting it in accessory use resolves the questions that we asked you to identify in streamlining the definition but i may be wrong and not understanding correctly im look agent that passage and i dont see how moving that to that piece of the code resolves the questions that we asked you to answer do you brent   its not entirely clear like what streamlined definition means so sort of   113635 am  consolidating ads as an accessory use to my mind as i read it spoke to the idea of a streamlined definition however did im mistaken on that were happy to engage on this issue any way council wishes i think all the guidance provided by the mayor and our council members has been really helpful and we look forward to bringing council a proposal that achieves all the different objectives that are outlined in the two different resolutions   tovo can i just ask do clarification where was streamlined not very clear   in the december resolution where it talks about bringing recommendations forward two a streamlined definition all i was saying councilmember tovo was the current direction thats proposed in the resolution for thursday that talks about sort of consolidating ads as accessory uses to me that dovetailed into that   113736 am  earlier direction and sort of provided the guidance needed to just bring it all forward as a single ordinance   okay you provided a long memo recommending some of these things if there is additional clarity needed for streamlining i think well have to go back to the memo that you provided but to the extent   just looking at the language that we provided it was talking about removing the requirements to age ability occupation or family status which in essence are within those different  we were streamlining because there are different descriptions of an accessory dwelling some are restricted by occupation some are restricted by age and family status so that is what was meant i didnt realize there was not clarity on what was meant by streamlined because we did actually define it if you could take a look at that passage and make sure there are still not questions about what supercell lined means i think thats really important i think thats the crux of   113837 am  that section was to make sure that we still dont have two family dwellings caregivers cottage or whatever those were called that was pretty well spelled out but if theres need for additional clarity we can certainly provide t and maybe this resolution provides us with the opportunity to do that but i thought between the resolutions and your memo and the conversations we had that we were pretty clear on what we meant by streamlining i think its critical that we get that right   mayor adler okay lets move on to the next item anybody have anything else on this   kelly can i just thank staff for all the work they did to help make this resolution possible i really appreciate you all being here today to answer questions as well   mayor adler thank you very much lets move on to item 66 this was pulled by councilmember harpermadison   harpermadison thank you chair im sorry i should have done this previously but im going to pass around an amendment to item number 66   113946 am  acm gonzalez i assume youre here to speak to 66   just here to help guide staff that will help answer questions   harpermadison thank you i appreciate that who would be the best staff member to speak to this compatibility item   so weve got erica leak from housing and planning development here as well as rosie truelove from housing and development   harpermadison are me here here or on the screen oh i see them thank you   harpermadison my first question is i would like to more about the process that led to the selection of the proposed distances in the resolution were they based on any of our peer cities in particular and were they    114047 am  informed by advice from staff i guess id like to know more about how we got to these specific numbers and back to my previous point about everybody in terms of the baseline everybody starting at the same level i think its helpful as a reference for all of us to be on the same point and understand the implications of this   sure and are you speaking to the distances that were included in the memo sent out on friday or something else   harpermadison im speaking specifically to the distances that we make reference to when we talk about the threshold under those circumstances it would be this height or this distance im speaking of those specific numbers i think 65 is one of the numbers and 90 is one of the other numbers i could get you specifically where the language  give me just a moment   mayor adler so i think thats probably a question councilmember harpermadison directed to the author and the sponsors because that came from    harpermadison oh i assumed those numbers were a part of  like built into   114149 am  the system those specifically came from the sponsors   mayor adler those came from the sponsors that came from the conversations weve had from a council and as a body over the last three years most specifically the conversation we had in november what we were trying to say if we were going to try and find where an agreement might be that people could agree on and move forward with greater than a sixfive vote or sevenfour vote what would that be so it was urging people to talk to people that they ordinarily dont talk to in our subquorums to try to come up with something that would represent not what anybody wanted but what we could agree on where the venn diagrams might cross with the hope of being able to pass something with enough of a group that we   114250 am  might avoid litigation and all other things so that they can be implemented and used at the same time the specific changes with respect to 60 to 65 and 40 to 45 came because we had been hearing collectively all of us from folks that were building that the extra five feet while not having a significant visual impact would have a significant impact on ability to put in desirable ground floor retail and other  kinds of uses so we also put in as we discussed if not last november is we discussed collectively as a body several weeks ago when we were saying hey what do people think about these kinds of issues would there be agreement on these even though we know that its not what anybody wants it goes too far for some people and not far enough for other people were just trying to find   114350 am  that spot   harpermadison im assuming the spokesperson so ill direct my questions to you i think the point i was trying to make is during the course of trying to level set i wasnt part of the original codenext conversations either as a layperson or even as a council person trying to acclimate and get caught up is complex to say the least i think its to my benefit as a member of my community and being able to speak in laymans terms to my constituents about this subject that frankly alooted d1 residents have been excluded from so i think  most of what im attempting to do is be able to speak to them about where the numbers come from and i think i understood it as you describe it but that almost sounds like the numbers are arbitrary i would like to be able to say that based on this is   114450 am  why we got here as opposed to this was the closest we could get to consensus id like to know if theres  that doesnt necessarily have to be something that gets answered right now but eventually i would like to be able to speak more to the numbers and the significance of the numbers   mayor adler and i think probably everybody might have different rationals that they each used to come to that place for me if also included taking a look at percentages of tracks that have been stopped and then taking a look at the kinds of opportunities that would be opened up or unlocked for being able to do this to see whether or not it was sufficiently material as to before and it seemed that way to me but i would defer to cosponsors on this mayor pro tem i dont know if you want to address how you got to the numbers for you   alter sure   114550 am  im just pulling up so i think we went back to the discussions that we had with codenext and looking at the working group and the zap resolution these are all found if you go to the message board where we originally posted our proposal theres some dynamics there theres some graphs there that show kind of various proposals for compatibility that had been put forward and i think we kind of looked at those  different  those different proposals as a starting point of okay weve had lots of discussions about these different pieces which kind of led us to have a range of what we were looking at and as we talked through that range we landed at particular numbers   114651 am  one of the reasons that we differentiated across the larger and the medium corridors was a sense that we didnt feel like the same compatibility rules should apply that we were comfortable with relaxing compatibility more if we designated some corridors as the larger corridors than if we  than we were on some of the medium corridors and because we were trying very much not to have it be a street by street process in terms of how we were doing it we wanted to have you know take definitions that we had that were well accepted and established so that it wasnt the street in and the street out but that there was some underlying planning concept that underlined the particular street choices it seemed that we should differentiate across those because one of the things   114752 am  that we had heard throughout the whole process from our community was that not every street was the same and what people were comfortable at on one street was not the same as another and to we had that sort of general idea of how do we do that if you look the 150 number for 65 was where zap and the working group were at and the codenext was at 100 and so we kind of said okay well do 100 on the large corridors but well do  100 feet or 65 on the larger corridors and well do 150 on the medium corridors so thats where we got the numbers and i think 100 is an easy number to understand having a round number is also important   harpermadison i appreciate that i think where i might be failing my constituents and this is no fault of anybodys but my own speaking out of turn i think i might be failing my constituents in that im   114854 am  saying we are relying heavily on the contribution of planning professionals to come up with these numbers were relying heavily on comparisons to peer cities etcetera and so i want to first of all make sure that thats accurate i dont want to share inaccuracies and i really appreciate    alter council member if i could add if you would go back to what we put up on the message board originally    harpermadison i made note of that    alter we made note of that with the peer cities and we were also looking at that   harpermadison its helpful   alter that was truly accurate when we did the original analysis   harpermadison its very helpful i was just trying to plain semi rational for some of my questions i want to make sure im sharing the most accurate information possible i appreciate the collaborative effort that it took for us to arrive here but i want to make certain that as we move forward that we dont lock ourselves into a single pathway without   114956 am  having a clearer  i dont want to say a better picture but a clearer picture of the tradeoff theres an image ive been using to try to orient myself and staff i gave you guys a graph i wonder if you could pull up that first image for me can everybody see that okay im assuming thats a yes if im reading this correctly what were trying to do with this item is to relax existing compatibility rules through a density bonus program were trying to grant extra entitlements in exchange for community benefits in my minds eye when we are experiencing a housing crisis like the one were in that we keep making   115057 am  reference to some of the questions that come about for me is whether or not there is nigh greater community benefit than more housing i think thats the greatest community benefit that we can all hopefully agree on especially some thats income restricted affordable housing so what this drawing shows for me is how compatibility mixes the community benefit that were looking for and the reasoning behind is to protect us from the singlefamily homes as the larger building and so when i looked at this and some of my questions will be influenced by this graph because it is really me trying to make sure i understand entirely before im trying to explain to people when i look at this i think we know that other cities have much less strict compatibility rules and they get by some of the comparisons that ive been able to make as a layperson is that other   115158 am  cities will less strict compatibility rules seem to do fine so im one trying to understand our heavy restrictions on compatibility and then also to understand that under this proposal were cutting dozens dozens of units for the benefit of a few singlefamily homes and whether theyre occupied by owners or renters or even shortterm rentals im trying to understand therition nail there    the rationale there im assuming staff would know   i think it sounded a little bit like a question maybe for other council members to some extent but we did want to make sure that all council members are aware that we provided some additional analysis about different compatibility options in a memo that was sent out on friday   115259 am  the title is information and analysis relating to vertical mixed use program so the last few pages of that attachment speak to the percentage of vmu zoned properties that could potentially reach their current base height or the future potential 90foot height based on the distance of compatibility standards so i dont know if we want to bring that up to talk through it its sort of a  sort of a different way to look at what information youve provided   harpermadison  inaudible i have one more question that i have based on the   115400 am  indiscernible that ive provided  inaudible  no mic   yes   harpermadison ill go back and look for that one but yeah if others see this as beneficial after this next slide  inaudible if we could pull up that next image please so when we talk about displacement and we know that people are getting priced out one thing we dont talk about is the hidden displacement thats caused by our inability to build homes for people who just want to live in our city so im really struggling to justify how we shape policy around ensuring that three to five percent more   115501 am  indiscernible what is now likely a fourmilliondollar home so really just trying to think through what our priority is  inaudible  no mic i guess the question i do have for staff is we have plan professionals on our city staff i think we should obviously take advantage of the subject matter expertise so my policy director    mayor adler natasha can you turn on your microphone    harpermadison im sorry i assumed it was on my policy director helped us construct these graphics during codenext and while theyre still relevant for years later but during that process the planning commission to my understanding voted to support compatibility trigger at 100 feet and i cant help but feel like based on the graphics and the answers to the questions   115602 am  that ive received it feels like were going backwards in terms of compatibility in which case im proposing that staff take a look at  i dont know if you guys got a copy of what i passed around im asking that staff take a look at the suite of options and bring us back a comprehensive analysis of each one as a full body so that we can make a data driven decision about whats appropriate when it comes to setting or when not to set the trigger for compatibility and thats what i passed around did everybody get one   inaudible   harpermadison no but im happy to im sure yall are watching can yall email our colleagues a copy of the two graph   inaudible   mayor adler or send them to the clerk and the clerk can put them in backup   115704 am  for todays work session   so council member some of the analysis we have completed already does address at least part of your question so maybe if council would like to do so we could talk through that   mayor adler okay go ahead   let me send the link the link to the av folks okay so if we could pull up that memo that we just sent the link to and sam tedford did the analysis so happy to have sam run through it and then   115805 am  we can all answer questions   while were waiting to get that pulled up good morning everyone sam tedford i will mention this memo speaks directly to the compatibility of impact on vmu and my understanding is many of the items  on item 66 would apply broadly to more properties so this analysis just looks at the impact on vmu zoned properties not all properties that might otherwise be able to participate in a bonus program and therefore get the compatibility reductions   kitchen could i ask one very quick question thank you very much for doing this and im looking forward to hearing this when you do it can you just let us know if youre basing it on existing compatibility or the item 66 proposed compatibility or some other just so we can remember   yes i can try and speak to some of the differences   kitchen thank you   if we could go down to   115905 am  page 14 i think that might be the most relevant starting place within this memo we compiled many staff responses to various council qa related to vertical mixed use but starting on page 14 you might see this table if we could make it a little bit larger on the screen youll see in our analysis of achievable heights for vmu zoned properties that have not redeveloped since 2010 so thats kind of our starting kind of our starting point sites that have the rezoning today and have not redeveloped since 2010 when the program was started so we can start at our current standards today for compatibility extend 540 feet away from a compatibility triggering property and so the result is that sites with vmu zoning only 46 of those properties could reach their base entitled height so thats what would be allowable under the vmu program today and 33 of those sites could   120007 pm  potentially achieve that bonus height under vm u2 that has been proposed so thats kind of our starting point under compatibility standards today and on the following slides we dont have to move youll just see kind of a visual that represents what these different proposals for compatibility look like or what staff was considering when we did this analysis youll see that theres two separated tables here one is where we maintain the properties that trigger compatibilities so those would be on your base zoning as well as certain land uses as well as some civic uses this has been some information not everybody fully understood within the land development code theres a set of civic uses that can also trigger compatibility on to an adjacent property those might be public or private schools colleges and universities religious assembly sites and so those are also uses that can trigger compatibility today   120108 pm   the table below that though is only  is  the analysis only for sites that has sf5 zoning today or more restrictive so we did the analysis for all compatibility triggering uses on the top and then on the bottom would be only zoning triggers and youll see the different versions here or if compatibility was limited to a certain distance from those compatibility triggering properties so version one would be limiting the extent of the compatibility to 300 feet from that property and the resulting impact on the number of vmu zoned sites that could reach their base height and then their bonus height so in this way theres a lot of information here where you can start to compare if we limited you know compatibility to 100 feet for the base height and then 150 feet or 250 feet for the bonus height you can kind of mix and match   120209 pm  and see what percentage of vmu sites would be able to reach and so thats what this memo has some additional detail and if you want to scroll you can see some of the visuals that we provided so that you understand what staff was analyzing specifically and im available to answer questions if you have any i have a quick question thank you this is excellent this is the data i was looking for so just help me understand so like where it says  let me just take one example say it takes version 4 for example so that means what height at 100 feet   each site may have a different base height the majority of the vmu zoned sites are either cs or dr which has a 60foot base height so that is the majority but there are going to be some that would have lower base heights because their base zoning is lr or lo and so those are lower but   120310 pm  theyre included there   kitchen okay so i could read this in most cases if im looking under zoning and land use triggers at the top chart at version 4 at 100 feet youre probably talking about a 60foot height from the base and a 90foot height for the bonus but then if i look at the bottom thats where the use doesnt trigger it just the zoning triggers it same deal im curious about that wouldnt  maybe i need to understand the difference between zoning and land use because i would have thought that the top one would trigger more if youre triggering both zoning and land use can you help me understand that   thats correct i think your understanding is correct so the number of sites that could achieve their  lets say just looking at the base zoning height is increased when   120411 pm   you go to zoningonly triggers in that lower category because there are fewer sites that have the ability to trigger compatibility onto those properties   kitchen higher percentage   so more sites could achieve their base height   kitchen so it could be  even though the percentage is like 86 at zoning triggers only it might be a higher number of properties in the 81 zoning and land use could that be the  maybe we could just as a followup item maybe you could give us the numbers behind the percentages that might help your 86 is a higher percentage but its of less properties right   no it is the same number of properties so it is a higher number of properties just like you said but would then be able to reach their base height   kitchen i apologize im trying to understand so if we have zoning and land   120512 pm  use triggers which is the top that means you would have more properties that would  oh i got you now its a reverse sorry   the number of vmu zoned properties are the same in each its just the number of surrounding compatibility   kitchen i got you i understand okay sorry thanks for working through that with me   mayor adler i hate to do this guys it is past noon so and this is my item i want to be here for this conversation were going to take a break between 1200 and 100 i dont know if you guys want to go into executive session inperson or without me or just take a lunch break and then come back here at 100 is that the preference lets do that were going to take a lunch break well be back here at 100 here at 1205 were in recess   11014 pm   mayor adler homelessness hopefully we can get that discussion done by 130 after austin energy well come back to these pulled items i think handling these pulled items is a really good thing todo its going to save us a lot of time thursday and hopefully direct us   thank you mayor and council this is a regular update that we provide to the council and the community on our efforts regarding people experiencing homelessness and the strategies and tools that we have to address them and i want to both appreciate and thank our incredible staff across many different departments but led by our chief homeless strategy officer diane    thank you well be pulling up the slides here thank you city manager mayor mayor pro tem and council   11114 pm  members we are happy to be here to give you an update on several elements of our work to address homelessness in the community but before i start i do want to acknowledge that im joined by folks from our partner departments we have laura la fuente aphs health equity and community engagement as well as laquisha johnson smothers to answer any questions related to their solicitations joined also by michael gates with real estate services and i believe if we have questions regarding our  the work on homeless encampment management audrey muntz with performance management may be available virtually to answer any questions you might have so do we have the slides up we can move on to the next one   11217 pm  thank you so the briefing today will cover four topics the first is an update on the progress of funding the investment plan for the finding home atx initiative which formerly was referred to as summit to address unsheltered homelessness the second which is related to finding home atx in that section well cover the progress of obligating american rescue plan acts that the council has approved for use to address homelessness in the third section well give an update on efforts to provide organization and infrastructure for the city staff theyre engaged in addressing unsheltered encampments related to the enforcement of the camping and heal initiative and finally ill provide an update specific to heal and the activities and outcomes related to that initiative with some comments from real estate regarding some of the questions that council members have had about the potential for   11319 pm  expanding shelter for that initiative so as a reminder the high level goals of finding home atx include housing an additional 3000 people over our baseline of folks housed in the community by the end of 2024 and to support those rehousing efforts we have a goal of creating 1300 more brickandmortar units for people who are exiting homelessness and finally well be providing prevention services and other social services to approximately another 2000 additional households this plan will support a wide spectrum of providers and housing developers and the overall investment plan for finding home atx is 515 million from all sources so that includes city county state federal and private funds over half of the funding would be dedicated to capital investment of deeply affordable    11421 pm  housing for this population and then the balance in programmatic expense as well as investments in our system our system infrastructure the capacity of our nonprofits just note that given the rampup of funding which well be talking about further in this presentation the investments will primarily result in rehousing focused in years two and three were beginning now to get the funding on the ground and so 80 of the goal will occur in years two and three next slide so we want to answer the questions about where we are on securing funding for the investment plan and also of the secured and anticipated funds where are those funds coming from we currently have identified 422 million or 82 of the 515 million investment plan resources and that represents an 8   11522 pm  million net increase since the last time we briefed council on this in february of 2022 so figure 1 represents the funding that is committed anticipated as well as the remaining funding gap since our last report weve had  as i said an eightmilliondollar net increase with the largest new sources of funding coming from an emergency rental assistance program at the texas department of housing and community affairs and as well as private philanthropy with most of those coming from the austin fc and others home atx has been in conversation with a number of likely significant contributors and well of course continue to report on that as progress is made   11637 pm  the next contributor are funds associated with the state of texas much of that is in the form of low income housing tax credits or pass through of federal funding but it is a quarter of the funds that weve secured to date from travis county private funders as well as the local housing authorities next slide so as we look at the funding that has been secured or is we believe very likely from ongoing funding sources across the categories of the finding home atx investment plan we see that our greatest progress has been in the categories of capital investment where we are at 92 of our goal with the remaining gap of about just over 21 million and in our core housing programs where we are at 83 of our goal with a funding gap of 305 million while the amounts to be   11737 pm  secured are smaller in the other categories shown in this graph our percentage of the total amount is lower system capacity we have secured 43 of the funds crisis services 69 of the funds and other services that include behavioral health employment and access to benefits weve secured 41 of the  funds that gap for those categories ranges between seven and 10 million per category finally ill note that weve included a contingency of 10 million which would need to be secured and were monitoring the need for additional funds across our categories in particular given the steep trajectory of increases in costs in real estate and construction we think that some increase in capital spending may be needed but well be reporting on that as we move   11839 pm  forward in our quarterly updates to council the arpa funds are an important part of the overall 15milliondollar finding home atx investment plan the table here shows the spending framework that council approved and as i said well be providing quarterly updates not only on the progress of finding home atx broadly but also on the commitment and expenditure of arpa funds that are dedicated to homelessness i would add that in addition to the briefing today we expect to a briefing to council either today or tomorrow as of the end of april we had expended approximately 48 million of arpa funds principally in capital related to hotel acquisition the remainder of the funds   11940 pm  will be distributed through a number of departments and today well have updates regarding the solicitation process from both austin public health where the bulk of our arpa funds will be deployed and then i will give a quick update on some funding that we are deploying through the innovation office so ill now turn it over to laura la fuente from austin public health health equity and public engagement division to talk about the process through austin public health   sorry thank you good afternoon laura la fuente with austin public health thank you for the opportunity to provide an update as weve shared before on this slide you will see kind of a plan for our homeless solicitation phase i was our housing stabilization solicitation and that solicitation we were soliciting for   12041 pm  permanent supportive housing services rapid rehousing services and also supportive services that was approximately 53 million that we were soliciting for community members nonprofits to actually apply for funding that solicitation was released on january 31st it closed on march 9th and we are anticipating making those award notifications some time this month our phase 2 application was our crisis response solicitation that was related to emergency shelter street outreach the day resource center medical care rethe city services youth crisis response that was approximately 99 million and these solicitation amounts are a combination of american rescue plan funding federal emergency  solution grants and homeless and housing service program so state funding were all part of the solicitation that solicitation was released on march 31st it closed on may 12th and we are anticipating making those notifications some time in the month of july the most recent   12142 pm  solicitation which is for supportive services for that slowing we were looking to specifically focus on employment services behavioral health supports and also benefit access that was another 75 million for the community to apply that was just released last week we are anticipating that that will close on july 7th with award notifications happening in august of 2022   thank you laura i want to thank laura and akeisha for the tremendous amount of work done on these proposals in a very short time frame and just to give you a sense the arpa dollars in these solicitations total approximately 60 million of the total 1067 million dedicated to homelessness so very substantial portion of the funds that we want to move toward our efforts in the community for that   12243 pm  purpose so next i want to speak to a substantially smaller solicitation but one that we think is really important in terms of supporting our nonprofit community bringing more service providers to the table and building their capacity the homeless strategy division has worked with the innovation office to develop a small grants program that program is specifically targeted to capacity building so organizational capacity building particularly for small nonprofits andor skill building in service delivery where a nonprofit might be moving into a new area of service delivery so the structure of this program is that all selected organizations which we believe may be up to 20 will receive a capacity assessment looking at both their organizational infrastructure and any competencies that they may   12344 pm  need to develop in service provision they will actually be compensated for participating in that capacity assessment because we know there are many nonprofits who are actually operating with a lot of volunteers and their time is valuable once that capacity assessment is complete we will have funding available of up to 37500 per organization to fund some of the capacity needs that may have been identified through that capacity assessment the application is designed to be really low barrier its quite  its pretty simple and so that application is due june 16th after which we would expect to launch activities you should this initiative some time in july again in partnership with the innovation office    12450 pm  so one of the things that council asked us to brief on today was homeless encampment management really encompassing enforcement generally and of course the process we have been engaged in with performance management in the financial services division to help support staff engaged in addressing homeless encampments with more infrastructure a better system to make it more efficient and i think be very clear about how were prioritizing the encampments i think the first thing i want to say is theres been an immense amount of work around addressing unsheltered encampments over 100 encampments have been cleared through enforcement since that work began in august of last year not including the heal encampments which ill speak to as well but we know that we through   12550 pm  that process weve identified some needs for staff to support them in that work i will mention that as of the end of may 252 citations have been issued around the camping ordinances sitlie and the panhandling that are also included in those ordinances which were approved on if may 1st of last year and so one of the questions weve had is how does enforcement compare to the heal initiative and i think the fundamental difference is that we have limited ability to connect individuals directly to shelter and service resources and because were not able to move people in to bridge shelter or offer that shelter it often means that there is significant displacement of those individuals from one location to other locations in the community   12650 pm  next slide please so as ive discussed previously in the fall we initiated a process to really look at how we could improve the infrastructure and support for staff doing this work audrey monks with performance management and financial services has been guiding that work doing an incredible job leading the work of over i think 15 departments which well look at in a moment and these are the priorities that that group identified as needs within this system first among them was creating a central response structure so we had an organized and supported way to determine how we would deploy our resources and then secondly creating a clear system for tracking encampments prioritizing identifying resources and organizing response so those are the two primary   12751 pm  areas that im going to speak to today and then  but we can certainly speak to some of the other work that is underway as well so this slide shows you the  all of the departments that have been involved in  this process so really gives a sense of how this issue homelessness generally but the impact of and service to unsheltered encampments touches many departments within the city next slide please so one of the two primary goals or first goals i should say of this process was to establish a central response structure that was cross departmental and the idea for this was the overall group would be establishing goals and   12853 pm  objectives we would have clear process for how to do the work and identify policies and procedures that could be shared across the city so central to this structure is a leadership team and that leadership team is comprised by the departments that are noted here austin fire austin police department austin resource recovery code homeless strategy division parks and recreation public works and watershed protection and the idea of the leadership team is that primarily it will be making decisions and approving operational plans that come up from the other sections that are noted here i will also say that the structure that has been created draws significantly from incident command structure so we were able to work with staff to really think about how we could organize this work for   12954 pm  clarity and clear decision making so the planning section will predominantly consist of staffed by a program manager one in our division austin fire department austin police arr and host and the currently impacted land departments for a particular encampment so when well be looking at  this is the section excuse me that well be assessing encampments well talk more about that when we move to the prioritization tool gathering that information and making a determination about which camps we need to intervene in which order essentially the operations and logistics section is activate when had a particular encampment is scheduled for an intervention whether that is enforcement and clearance or heal the chief will be the single point of contact from the landowning department and   13055 pm  this section will develop the operational plan for the particular encampment with a clear essentially incident commander if you will leader for that particular event producing an operational plan that then is approved by the leadership team the policy section will have departments that are participating depending on the policy that needs to be developed for example were currently working on a general encampment closure protocol so we have watershed protection apd pard and downtown austin community court looking at the overall policy for closure but it is anticipated that this group would look at specific policies as well like how we handle belongings and the treatment of bio hazards that we encounter during this work    13155 pm  ill move next to a description of the prioritization tool that we have developed for the cross departmental use and ill just say that im very excited about this work were looking at a tool which i think is really going to support us in sharing information and understanding the conditions in different encampments and what kind of interventions are needed so this is a webbased tool this is an app that is being developed the idea being that were able to collect information about a particular encampment so that we understand both sides and the conditions in that encampment and what weve done is to model this assessment after the tool that we developed for heal the same questions are asked for both assessments but heal is scored differently   13256 pm  and were really looking at the health and safety of the occupants of the encampment in those cases and so the tool will auto score for both scenarios and allow us to both prioritize encampments for heal and to identify those higher priority encampments that are impact the public safety or health more generally the field testing is underway through the month of june and we expect to be ready to be using that more broadly in july so ill move then to the heal initiative which now has affected the closure of nine sites the first four of course were the sites that were identified by council in the original resolution and since then we have done another five sites   13357 pm  most recently gillis park since the inception of the initiative we have transferred 267 individuals from encampments into bridge shelter this fiscal year that number is 119 and that is against a fiscal year goal of 200 individuals so we are on track to meet that goal we always report on shelter acceptance rate because we think its very important to continue to track and to understand that the vast majority of people who are offered transfer to shelter do accept it to date the acceptance rate is 93 the current bridge shelter occupancy as of the 17th of may was 123 individuals so this was just after the relocation of gillis park and since the beginning of the initiative we have firmly reroused 79   13459 pm  individuals one of the things that council explicitly asked us to track for this initiative was demographics to ensure that our approach isnt having unintended consequences in terms of equity with a particular  focus on the percentage of africanamericans being served because that community is so disproportionately impacted by homelessness so in the overall population of people experiencing homelessness 37 are africanamerican and in heal 45 of those individuals served have been africanamerican were going to be looking at this a little more closely we do know that africanamericans are more likely to be unsheltered when they are homeless not only to experience homelessness but more likely to experience unsheltered homelessness the percent of hispanic and latino individuals is 15 compared to 26 of people   13600 pm  experiencing homelessness so similarly were going to investigate that to understand is that related to a difference in the population of people experiencing unsheltered homelessness or do we need to be very concerned that somehow were not reaching encampments that have significant populations of individuals identifying as hispanic or latino our percentage of ratio male to female is 673 male compared to roughly 62 in the population 326 female in heal compared to 377 in the overall population so in the next slide ill pass it to michael gates with real estate services and this is related to some questions that council has asked related to the progress and considering options for potentially expanding bridge shelter   13700 pm  through additional acquisition of property   good afternoon mayor and council might gel gates with financial services this slide here is to explain how the market for the hospitality industry is basically rosie at this point it was the case that some of these operators and owners were hanging on by their fingernails now the folks calling us a year ago arent returning our phone calls its a perfect confluence of a lack of prospects and to be quite frank sticker shock so i dont want to get into any specific numbers but we are not looking to condemn apparatus we are acting as a market actor so we are making unsolicited offers to entice hotel owners to sell to us so the leverage is with them to demand a freeman that and the asking price  a premium for that and the asking price has been a significant jump rap in what theyre looking for   13803 pm  so just i guess to manage your expectations and it would be helpful to gauge councils appetite you may recall any substantial public findings over the last couple of hotels these are incomeproducing properties so the appraisal process for these is essentially kind of going through the books and seeing what those properties are generating from an income standpoint you typically go back two years that  is going to be right over overlapping basically the heart of covid and again kind of the difference between the agreed upon purchase price given what these things will appraise at the situations are likely to be exacerbated to go back two years for the appraisals but anyway just to go through the bullet points here the return of the individual business travelers is a big part of the increase the hotels were looking for are the extended types the dual sinks and those frequented by business travelers   13904 pm  that market is rebounding and the business owners are excited about the prospects the demand in general the average daily rate per room has increased  forecast to increase by 17 this year over last year and then the basically the average daily rate is driving the revenue per available rooms above 2019 that was prepandemic levels so again what theyre asking for i dont want to get into numbers but its going to be pricey and that might cause some financing perspectives some issues or concern on our end but thats it for the slide   thank you michael were happy to answer any questions council members might have at this time   mayor adler any questions ann and then natasha   kitchen thank you very   14004 pm  much for the presentation i appreciate the update i have some specific questions maybe for michael or maybe for others so i hear the challenges in terms of the approach that we have in taking for acquiring hotels for bridge shelter my understanding is maybe this is for you ms gray we have two shelters operating the north bridge and the south bridge and those are the locations for she wanterring folks that are in the heal program as they progress through to permanent housing im wondering what the solution is because is there a different approach different kinds of properties that we need to look at or what would you suggest im operating under the   14108 pm  premise that we need to acquire another shelter for two reasons one is that one of these i cant remember which one i think the north bridge is slated to become permanent supportive housing which we need which is going to put us behind on the heal initiative once we turn that and lose that for shelter the other thing is the heal initiative although certainly a piece that we do has been a successful piece to date and one of the things thats working for heal is actually targeting prore locations around the city that are high risk locations so its a very targeted approach to address those situations so from  my perspective i would like to see us be able to accelerate heal but i see the availability of bridge shelter as a linchpin for our availability to expand so i guess i see you nodding your head so its probably   14208 pm  right that its a linchpin so my question is whats the next step then whats the thinking mr gates on what we should be doing are there different kinds of properties to look at or do you need direction from council in terms of what we can pay or whats the  whats the thinking   thank you for that question council member we are looking at hotels and motels but also nursing homes as well and then just kind of any prospects we bring to hso for consideration one of the ideas donna and i recently discussed is the prospect of building to spec win of the things is when we look for hotels that are for sale we are at the mercy of wherever they lie so they may not be ideally good with respect to locations but its counterbalanced by the delivery of that hotel that can stand up and be renovated much quicker than building to spec   14308 pm  theres that i think we were talking about  i dont want to throw out numbers so anyway that might be an option particularly in your district theres only one hotel and one motel in all of district 5   kitchen thats right   a little shocking but anyway to put one in your district we would almost certainly have to build to suit so that could be an option i dont know if there are any thoughts about other    sure i agree we need to look at all the otions but in terms of heal of course and addressing the issue in our community more rapidly timeliness is a priority so i think that we certainly have been looking at possibilities i think that real estate bringing those potential contracts to council in executive session and getting a sense of what the appetite is what the considerations are in terms of balancing our ability to move quickly with the shifts in the marketplace   14411 pm  but certainly i think real estate beginning to widen the horizon if you will about other types of properties that might also be able to be deployed quickly its just not apparent right that there are other properties that are as well suited as hotels might be   kitchen so whats the timeline when can we expect to  when can we expect to start looking at specific options    weve got two site visits scheduled for this week i believe two hotel prospects that well be making site visits if any of those get legs maybe six seven months if everything goes swimmingly id like to hege my bets and say possibly eight to nine months more likely time frame but if were again pursuing existing hotels thats probably the earliest  i should say close on something assuming council approval   kitchen so when would you bring it to council because i know there are   14511 pm  several steps before you postpone i would like to have the conversation about what those are   id like to get the executive session id say maybe about two months out and then thats assuming we are able to negotiate a property price with the property owner and really to gauge i should have at that point an idea of our internal cost estimate and then to have you guys consider the delta between the potential asking price versus what we have the numbers at internally and then well have to have it formally appraised and  but if you guys are  thats something you guys are  have an appetite for we can move forward i mean ultimately for a lot of these owners were talking to now its just money   kitchen okay so thank you for that im trying to nail that down in my mind when we might have an executive session so you can tell us the places that youre looking at   so i know the first council meeting after the break is july 28th again assuming these two    14611 pm  we still have to walk them and make sure theyre going to work but if either of them do we could come back that week tuesday and talk about kind of what the owner is looking for   kitchen okay city manager ive been asking for an executive session so that we could get specific on the properties so that first work session or council meeting that we come back in july id like to schedule that   absolutely council member as the staff have said they are pursuing as many active possibilities as they see and are presented to them and they are aggressively going after them as well and we will not delay in bringing those options to you ideally we would have that available for that council meeting and im not going to wait and we could even call a special meeting if we have information sooner than that   thats on properties youre pursuing what about the build spec option   we have not fully explored that that was a conversation we   14711 pm   had about that i think donna feels that the price to build new remembers the existing price is still the price to build new would exceed what asking for for an existing building   i get that that makes sense as we take more time to continue to look for places we could have caught up building something so i would hope that we would simultaneously look at those two options so we could   most of those tracts of land for edd for affordable housing efforts we can have those   14814 pm  conversations about possibly taking them out of the queue and repositioning for shelter   kitchen perhaps city manager we could i know weve examined those properties for other things but i would like to see the report for city land that could be used to potentially build the spec i understand and absolutely agree thats not the best course of action but i also dome want to just take a very long time and at the end of the day not be able to find anything else it would seem to me we could do some initial analysis at least to understand whether we have some potential land at the same time that youre continuing to pursue the other options do you have the bandwidth to do that or is that  who has to do that   its going to be a multiple departmental conversation but need to get with edd first and see where   14915 pm  theyre at with the first properties obviously talk to diana and get they are input on a promising prospect we need to get public works also involved its going to need to be a comprehensive discussion   kitchen city manager i would like that to be done on a simultaneous basis whoever has to do that so that i really  i know our staff is doing everything they can but its really feeling like its running late to me and it one of our successful initiatives that we need to  six seven eight nine month or more lead time were already looking at next year most likely before we can add another shelter and that just doesnt work for this initiative it holds us up having more   15023 pm  existing housing    this is a community challenge and i encourage us to look beyond the walls of city hall and beyond our own departments and really work with our partners to expand our shelter capacity i know thats part of the overall infrastructure that were trying to create and shore up and  with people experiencing homelessness but we do need to make sure that more partners are at the table and thank you for continuing to support those efforts as well from each of your standpoints   kitchen thats fine i understand that we need options   mayor adler the same part of the presentation the sheltering issue   harpermadison for what its worth i think that councilmember kitchen covered a lot of my questions i think the only thing i would add is certainly not to be pessimistic but i wasnt convinced from the start that the hotel conversion strategy was going to be what sustained us moving forward i really thought it was a   15124 pm  long shot frankly and the more difficulty we got getting into various parts of town i was already sort of looking in the direction of other options in which case my question to piggyback on councilmember kitchens question my question was going to be what are our other options whats completely not even remotely viable whether or not this strategy is untenable im certainly not asking you to make that announcement today but i would appreciate  id rather now than not  know than not whether the approach that council is taking whether or not the direction weve offered is viable in which cases to councilmember kitchens point michael you and i have had this conversation about city held property and assets district 1 has a lot of them but two our conversation about distributing housing for formerly homeless people we want to distribute it citywide that said if we are going to be bumping up against the   15227 pm  reality of councilmember kitchen having virtually none in her district but me having a lot in our district i think its fair for us to recalibrate based on those hotels so given the conversation we had earlier with the union folks and labor folks with the difficulty around budget considerations i think this will be another really difficult conversation where in terms of equity it wont feel equitable and like one of the things we talked about earlier today was lifeguard shortages anecdotally i know a bunch of black kids that signed up but racism they dont know how to swim that was one of the things  one of the ancillary considerations you know what i mean i think in a lot of ways well have a lot of those during the course of this conversation so my hope is that you all just feel at liberty to be entirely candid and say yes we can do that no we cant do that yes that will work that absolutely wont work youre wasting your time im hoping we can lean on your expertise to really guide us in the appropriate    15328 pm  direction for offering you all support and i think the only other thing i would add is i think you spoke to it city manager about additional partnerships obviously as a municipal body we have the opportunity to ask but i wonder if independently we have the opportunity as council members as members of these communities that we live in to ask folks to join the fight and if thats the case i think it might be helpful to have a comprehensive list of who we asked what was their response cho who havent we asked i think if its all hands on deck which im hearing that it is id like for us to not duplicate one anothers efforts and thank you all for your effort i know this has  not from the start of the conversation hasnt been an easy solution to try to approach thank you for your hard work i appreciate you all   mayor adler im going to raise a quick issue and then turn it over to pio   15432 pm   i agree we need to know what our options are or not we need to assess them realistically for what we have and absolutely there is an opportunity for other people to help when youre doing that analysis its also important to keep in terms of the context of what were trying to achieve i just spent the last week at the united states conference of mayors and there were people there who you might imagine across the country dealing with homelessness because its such a big cities the white house had the national director that agency and department and you had a lot of providers and consultants who are working if you go to websites the ones that are working with 100 different cities in the country and the like also had the chance to discuss what we were doing with them with those groups and with the office of the secretary of hud who are all real excited and hopeful about what it is that were trying to do here in austin because were actually building out the system and   15532 pm  the infrastructure to actually solve homelessness to actually be able to reach net effect of zero citywide and then thats not something a city our size has done and it is a hard transition to get from here to there generally speaking our systems allow us to handle the number of people that are showing up on any given day experiencing homelessness because we can provide services and housing for people and we could reach an equilibrium place generally speaking with what we have now except that we have this mouse in the middle of the boa thats approximate thousand people on our streets that were trying to deal with and we need to resolve that mouse so that we can keep our kind of equilibrium going but we have to do it in a way that doesnt spend all our money   15637 pm   immediately sheltering the mouse because well never fix the problem the challenge we have in getting people off the street in a way theyll be able to stay off the streets which means we have to actually house those people so theres a balance and i think part of the analysis that councilmember kitchen is asking for and councilmember harpermadison are asking for in terms of realistic and presenting our options is what can we do without compromising or taking our eyes off the ball which is to actually solve this and keep that in front of us so that we understand this to that end weve heard there are lots of different things we can do the sooner we get the housing online manager this is not just a sheltering issue if we could get some of the homes that the buildings that  up and online a year year and a half earlier than they are thats a huge number of people   15737 pm  its a huge expense if we dont have to find a temporary solution or to out size our shelter operation to the rest of the system so i repeat again and i think our council has passed several resolutions on it i dont know what that would take to sit down with the project people and say what can we do from a city perspective austin energy water our development team how could we sit down and brainstorm with people who are developing these properties and say how could we get them online a year earlier than we might otherwise be able to get them online because that i think is the most perfect answer to the question because thats getting people off the streets and out of tents and actually into the heal solution because youre getting them into the homes so i reiterate the request on that i dont know if its a question of resources to move more people into that because i know development services is already tasked   15838 pm  but i cant think of anything thats a higher priority than trying to get affordable housing projects coc units psa units up and operating in our city much more quickly than would otherwise happen   thank you mayor i want to echo that were facing a really land price crisis here in austin also the evaluation is just gone up through the roof here ive seen a lot of these hotels and motels that have been empty on the eastside and now theyre fixing them all up so people are investing in the hotels now and its definitely rising up the prices double what the rate of increase is going up on property value here in austin have you taken a good look   15939 pm  at the prices that these units are selling for now    i dont have an average off the top of my head and its all over the map i mean particularly in  there are different factors to do that for instance the cbd those  given how theyre impacted its difficult to tackle but we could derive at an average in the city of austin proper   renteria the thing were facing also is were land locked now we cant just go out and annex any property and the increase thats going on here has just gone crazy i do  i know that we have done a study in the past about all available city land that could be used for housing so the study has been done i just really encourage our staff and you guys to go out there and take that and run   20040 pm  with it and see how and how we can build were sitting on st john out there theres a lot of nonprofit groups that are sitting on land but they dont have the resource to build these units if we could work together with the housing department and identify all this property so we could start building as fast as we can and hopefully that we can relax some of the density clause and codes that we have so that we can build a lot more   mayor adler okay anything else before we get to austin energy as quickly as we can lets move through those   kelly thank you so much for being here   mayor adler councilmember tovo you were next no go ahead shes next   kelly thank you thank you for being here thank you for the presentation thank you for the updates i have one question and a couple of statements what is the plan for the programs once were out of   20141 pm  arpa funding   so one of the things weve done is to focus arpa funding on programs that can be downsized so for example were not funding services in permanent supportive housing with arpa funds because we know those are services that need to be sustained the mayor spoke to our current resourcing likely to be adequate to serve the new people that enter homelessness in a particular year but we have this large population of people who have been waiting so its clear that sort of unmet demand if you need  if you will means we need an influx of resources so one of the things were asking providers to do is to look at the rampup of these one time funds and then sort of allowing those programs to demobilize i think that well know at the end of these three years    20241 pm  which of those programs are particularly effective and we may want to look at our resource distribution at that point but we are very clear that with the arpa funds we have capital investment which is of course one time and then with services that this is a one time contract and of course well be looking at effectiveness at the end of that road   kelly thank you for explaining that i think its helpful for the public to be reminded of it as well and in your presentation you showed the part about the central response structure for homeless encampment management and im glad to see youre leaning on the incident command system for response its helpful because public safety follows that everyday anyway im hopeful that new way of working together with assist in a more coordinated response for you all and real briefly i wanted to thank councilmember kitchen for including me as a sponsor on the heal initiative yesterday i had the ability to tour lions gardens and i met an individual who was   20342 pm  previously experiencing homelessness and then housed there as part of that strategy so it was real humbling and i had this real big sense of pride and i think we all in favor colleagues have a sense of pride knowing that it is effective and it does work and we all did that together so thank you   mayor adler councilmember tovo   tovo   tovo i have a couple of quick questions but first well start with where councilmember kelly and that was on the homelessness encampment management prioritization tool when you say that its estimated full implementation in i recall july is that on all of it so in early july the kind of streamlined process involving the different departments is going to be in place and ready for the    the tool and the central response structure so the tool is being field tested now in july we anticipate really   20445 pm  rolling that out assessing a lot of encampments weve been doing that as we go for heal and then the centralized response would be stood up the groups are already meeting but at that point we would be utilizing the tool to help the teams organize their work by virtue of prioritizing the plans and pass them up to the leadership team to approve and make decisions etcetera   tovo i see    i think some of these are going to be ongoing because the standardized protocols for example were starting with the really fundamental   20546 pm  closure protocol but we know there are other policies that well need to  that well need to identify and define so i think we can come back  we did in the public health committee last time show that more detailed timeline were happy to do that in the next public health committee meeting which i believe is in august   tovo my other question is one ive asked before and that is about kind of assessing the hotel motel option in terms of structural fitness i know ive asked this question before and im really glad that youre looking at other options on too which i hope will include apartment complexes and other things that should also be in the mix i think ive understood that youre looking at a range of options not just hotels at this point i attended a meeting that ill have to ask the mayor to remind me the name of its the group of different nonprofits that are working together o diana working together to craft the affordable housing   20647 pm  partnerships that the county is sponsoring with their funding like the travis county collaborative   travis county supportive housing collaborative   tovo thank you and connor kinney was talking about the new development and the work theyre doing its very interesting super interesting collaboration super interesting conversation but in talking about the level of construction he used the term that will developments will be built to student level housing levels of durability to it will be manageable ive asked that question before about hotels id be interested to know how much assessment weve done on that because my sense of it is that probably hotels are not built to that same level this is well out of my league of expertise but im thinking about how people use hotels and theyre not used for the most part as ongoing residences so i wonder if that is just   20749 pm  something we should consider and when i heard connor kinney talking about student levels of durability for ongoing use i thought i would throw that out there and see if you continued to think through the level of construction and if hotels are our best fit and if they arent how are we mitigating that before residents move in    thank you and first of all one thing i do want to say is i think that the hotel conversion strategy has been successful it has added a tool to our toolkit for quickly adding capacity and it has many of the hotels that sort of flexibility of we can use this as shelter and then convert it to permanent housing is a real benefit so we know were not overbuilding shelter for the longterm were really adding to that portfolio of housing what i will say is that certainly we have experience in the community foundation communities has done several   20849 pm  hotel conversions in the past but i want to give you one example of something wife done which i think will really help us in terms of the longterm renovation for the hotels in may early may we went with many of the members of the travis county supportive housing collaborative to visit supportive housing deals in houston and this nonprofit among many strengths has very strong property management strengths and was really able to go  we went through the buildings and to say here are the choices weve made here are some of the different choices we would make now in terms of materials etcetera and our operators who are helping us scope the renovation of pecan garden and bungalows at century park were on those tours so i think we are really looking at the finishes that are important i think structurally all of these buildings are built to code   20950 pm  they will be very similar a lot of the learnings are about finishes and some of the fittings etcetera of the units   tovo that makes sense thank you thats really interesting and i assume there are different  there will be some different needs like maybe first floor storage because again people are living there and they may not want to take their bikes and things or strollers i imagine some of those things are a little bit different from hotel configurations as well but thank you thats very useful   mayor adler all right i think were ready to move to austin energy are we ready thank you very much   thank you   pool thanks everybody   mayor adler im going to adjourn the work session here today at 210 well reconvene after the austin energy committee is over ill turn it over to you madam chair  part 2  mayor adler great and then at 310 well go ahead and reconvene the austin city council meeting here on june 7th 2022 colleagues we have an hour and 50 minutes left we have yet to finish the  discussion on item number 66 also potential discussion on 80 we also have the personnel matters for executive session do we think we can make enough progress so that we could actually get to executive session today   31120 pm  or do we want to let the staff members    kitchen just a reminder ill be leaving at 345   mayor adler okay lets push through these and see if we can get to executive session at 345 or 400 lets go back to item number 66 council member harpermadison   harpermadison thank you there are two things i was going to ask in the interest of time everybody can read i passed out all the amendments and i think we offered enough in the way of rationale to where you guys can sort of go through and see what amendments i intend to bring forward on item number 66 it is not often that i say that i dont envy being a man but today im going to say it i dont know how yall are wearing these sport coats its hot in here am i the only one whos burning up hot right now because i could have my staff bring down a personal fan if its just me   ill tell someone   harpermadison okay thank you   mayor adler and it would be helpful  thank you for handing these out and thank you   31223 pm  council member vela for also handing these out if people would have any opportunity tomorrow to weigh in and comment on those on the message board that might be helpful if you want to say here are the things we handed out maybe get a feel for where people are before we convene on thursday i know that would be helpful there were three amendments both from council members vela and harpermadison   tovo would you mind clarifying im not sure i got all the amendments were they coming from both of you together or individually   harpermadison council member velas are three pages it says amendment 1 amendment 2 and amendment 3 theyre not stapled and mine are amendment 1 2 and 3 also but theyre stapled   tovo i have  mayor  adler would you hand these to    31331 pm  kathie would you hand these to kathie   tovo council member vela i think i need yours i dont think i have any of yours thank you   ellis could i also ask putting them on the message board ive been able to ascertain copy of them but when youre remote you cant see what people are handing out   mayor adler if you guys can post your amendments to message board that would be helpful can you go ahead and post these in backup that would be great thank you can our conversation on 66 council member kitchen   kitchen i have a question question i think it applies to council member vela and harpermadisons amendments you can put it on the message board if youre not clear right now i just want to make sure i understand what the thinking is   31432 pm  by the term transit priority network and the reason im asking that is because theres a lot of different terms out there for project connect for the bus network cap metro has different terms the city has different terms i dont know if you intended the same thing but what yall are intending with that term   vela council member kitchen looking at the maps on the working group proposal one of the issues that kind of jumps out at me when i kind of toggle it around on the excellent map that staff rated the vmu 2 and compatibility map the transit priority network seems to include a broader network of streets and also if we dont include the asmp transit party network were really not even touching   31534 pm  anything west of lamar or anything west of mopac   kitchen okay thats what i wanted to peg it to marked as transit priority network   vela thats correct   mayor adler ill take a look at that i think the thinking was most of the additional roads that would be picked up are residential in nature there were also roads having gone through this experience before that when they were listed as possibilities created such a concern and alarm youre really not going to pick up the benefit of this but prevented us i think from being able to move to a conversation on some of the other elements because we could never get past that    31638 pm  so we tried to address that with the things that we had picked and then also calling out certain roads as being nonincluded but ill take another look for me and any office at the roads that are on that list but i think thats high level where that comes from yes   harpermadison and ive only got five bullets to speak specifically to that number one our imagine austin corridors were identified in the comprehensive plan that we adopted a decade ago so while they reflect where back then they may have been appropriate where growth might happen i dont think they necessarily tell us anything about today todays standards i dont think they tell us where on the ground it would support   theyre supportive of is there more transit friendly development housing specific development the transit priority network however was established by the asmp that we adopted three years ago in which case it seemed   31739 pm  more relevant timewise to council member velas point about looking at the stark differences with the mapping im super visual for me that stood out as well it largely overlaps with imagine austin corridors it features a more equitable distribution of corridors i think to the point that you were making council member vela particularly in our higher opportunity neighborhoods in the central city lastly if the idea is to achieve our asmp goals at 5050 split goals by allowing denser less car dependent development i think it makes sense to do that where there is frequent transit service to support that   kitchen thank you thats very helpful i support a broader coverage and ive been concerned that when we pegged  well you know when we pegged to just certain transit lines we dont   31843 pm  get all of town we particularly dont get the best side of town we havent had as much transit opportunity west of mopac so its perpetual this one we peg to that and on and on and on and we dont ever get to our goals of looking at all of austin so i support the concept ill go back and remind myself where this is but i certainly support the concept that youre talking about   mayor adler council member tovo   tovo i think it would be helpful if we had a list of  i mean i remember it the way you do mayor i think the corridors that you all have identified as medium and large are in essence the transit priority corridors minus some of the ones that were causing concerns    31943 pm  so were going to very quickly i think just return to the very same conversation we had and i think its very challenging at this point to try to have this conversation alongside the asmp discussion alongside the mu2 if we really dont have lists of streets op how we get from here to there on thursday but i can tell you once the asmp became the measure for how we based land use decisions there became a lot of concern around asmp were probably going to be flooded now with a lot of concerns again about the asmp if the definitions are going to trigger compatibility loosening in this other proposal so again i dont know if there are other members of the work group who put forward this proposal who have a sense of what is in the transit priority network that is not in imagine   32044 pm  austin corridor or a bond construction corridor or other things that were identified in medium and large   vela council member pool  im sorry tovo just very briefly the lake austin boulevard would be one of them altorf i think is a a relatively good opportunity area for compatibility limits and additional housing i believe that 51st street is another one in my district again just thinking about my districts but again i would  the map is really excellent that staff put together where you can toggle those images on and off and you get a really good sense of the maps that were looking at   tovo ill take a look so ive had several meetings with my community members  my   32149 pm  area probably has more vmu 2 than some of the other corridors that were talking about and i know that most of the folks im talking to are really struggling to understand in a very quick manner of what the proposal is several of the streets you named are also in my district i would say the more information we can provide the better people are really struggling to try to catch up in the midst of multiple other zoning changes in district 9 and various other things okay thank you thank you for those couple examples ill take a look at the interactive map   mayor adler mayor pro tem   alter so i just would like to understand what streets with commercial zoning constrained by compatibility west of mopac are you trying to pick up lake austin boulevard is imagine   32249 pm   austin corridor it is largely governed by the breckenridge track which is under ut its largely exempt from compatibility by and large the streets west of mopac dont have the commercial zoning so the compatibility constraints there are not the constrainting factor so id be curious to know which streets beyond lake austin boulevard youre trying to get at this does include jollyville road for instance the version that we have does include the frontage road on mopac also west of mopac so you may not have them right now but it would be helpful for you to share that because part of what happens and we looked at this in our group because we were trying to decide whether to do tpn or imagine austin when you move to tpn you dont   32351 pm  actually have much impact in west austin because we dont have the transit which the tpns were based off of so you get a whole lot of other neighborhoods in there and makes it more difficult to reach an agreement and those are largely outside of west austin where that impact has this is not the only tool that we have in our tool  excuse me to address the density we have one  i dont remember if its this week or next week on the district planning we have that we have the whole process with the ut folks thats going on   32455 pm  this change is not metropolitan to be the only thing that were doing as could be evidenced by the things on our agendaant to be the only thing that were doing as could be evidenced by the things on our agenda the work that were doing will add a lot of density potentially so there are opportunities to do things i think we should not try to make every tool have to fix everywhere i did want to ask a couple questions of council member harpermadison i wanted to understand why you wanted to eliminate the asmp level 5 streets the major highways from being considered larger corridors   harpermadison i think the simplest answer is because theyre highways and i dont want us to prioritize putting multifamily typically lower income housing on small crowded loud highways i think generally speaking its not a consideration that we take   32556 pm  often enough the environmental impact of people living off the highway thats the easiest way to describe my rationale there    alter okay i think that will take density out of west austin for that i think that there have been few occasions where we havent put increased density along the highway when its come before us i think we recently put an mf6 or 90 feet on mopac in my district we did an lipda in district 1 right off the highway this year im not sure how i can justify why we would have highways having stricter compatibility rules than others i have constituents who have single family homes right up to mopac right against the sound barriers as well so you know i just want to be clear part of the reason we   32657 pm  have that in there is to make sure that we are allowing for some of that density in other parts of town as well so i just wanted to explain that and then for amendment 3 i wanted to make sure that everyone was aware of part 3d on page 3 of item 66 where we say for any residential or mixed use property on a corridor allow more flexibility for what could be located in the 25foot setback but not including dumpsters so i want to understand and think through what youre proposing in this a little bit more before thursday i feel like theres a lot of things with the rationale where i might agree with that but im not sure if i agree with the language that was used to convey that and i kind of feel like the   32757 pm  language that we have in there would allow staff to explore what youre saying with respect to the setback and i dont want to preclude them from doing the other things that we had in mind when we were doing that so i just wanted to flag them and think more about that one on that   mayor adler i think thats an interesting one and i want to understand that one better   harpermadison do you mind if elaborate a tiny bit about the highway i gave what i thought was pretty broad explanation but to be more clear i think  so dr bullard he gave this speech one time about why black and brown kids miss school and he asked everybody in the room to say why why why and they had all these reasons but the ultimate reason why black and brown kids miss school the most is asthma   32857 pm  its environmental exposure and so that was one of the things and just historically the recognition of you know what the implication of highways have including having housing just thinking through our mode access being right off the highway definitely deters having more people especially people who really need access to transit having more mode split options more biking options more transit options when theyre right off the highway i think being in the center of a neighborhood with more access around transit and more access around walking and biking options is the ideal in which case i think to  the point that you were making earl crore about every tool not suiting every scenario im perfectly open to continuing the dialogue and want to get closer to a place where it doesnt feel   32957 pm  inadvertently like were adding more in the way of inequity hopefully that helps and to the point about continuing the conversation id be curious to know what staffs thought is whether or not the additional language that im offering somehow you know is a deterrent for the language offering in the original so i look forward to expanding on that conversation   mayor adler council member kitchen   kitchen yeah i think one thing thats interesting about this conversation is the differences in the city you know along the freeway along mopac is very different been along the freeway and some other parts of the city and i hear what council member harpermadison is saying which rings more true in my parts of town along the freeway is not a transit corridor i mean its not where we have   33057 pm  identified you know a rail line or metro rapid lines and stuff like that so i was always curious about why i was included in the first place i understand the reasoning and i understand and appreciate the effort you know i agree with the effort as mayor pro tem explained it but using that to get further into west austin is great but its not useful for the whole city because of the kinds of things that council member harpermadison is mentioning so i think we really need to rethink that a im inclined to strike it also as council member harpermadison is suggesting but it could use some more conversation i think we may be agreeing on what were trying to accomplish here but were pointing out some differences across the city that are impacted so anyway im open to more   33159 pm  conversation it never made sense to me to include them in the first place   mayor adler i think part of the reason  i think council member harpermadison is proposing an even broader conversation which is where theres a city we should allow multifamily uses along highways   kitchen well no shes very specifically talking about leaving this for this   mayor adler no she did link it to this what i said is it gives rise to a broader conversation and the rationale for it as i understood it was its not the appropriate place to put housing not appropriate  place to put faculty family housing and i want to think through what that  because we do that now and we do that in parts of the city if were going to do it then i would probably include it in here if were not going to do that or we think that thats not from   33259 pm  a policy standpoint something that we want to do then i think that gives rise to that broader question because its not  you know it seems funny to have higher height on roads like south lamar than along a highway its not the height issue one of the reasons well have the height there is because you can have the height along highways unless its a use that we dont want to have along highways so i want to be thinking about that question   kitchen but the point im hearing is i thought we were trying  i get that and im certainly open to more conversation but i thought we were trying to talk about more housing along places that people can get out of their cars and get on a bus thats not the case on an access road to a freeway so thats  its two different things this might be okay to do two   33401 pm  different things one thing might be pegging to transit one thing might be pegging to other kinds of corridors that we think are appropriate for  you know for housing   mayor adler i think in the hearts of that i think transit is one of the reasons why we pick a road we pick a road  it was both higher and transit oriented roads so i dont think we were just looking for ones that had a line on it we cant always be sure theres going to be a line on it because the lines changed there was something also just about the more intense characteristic of the road itself in a nonresidential way im saying this is a point that i need to think through because it might be a good point for the reasons that council member harpermadison  the rationale for the reasons council member pool and then   33502 pm  well come back   pool i guess what im unsure about and the question for me is if we remove from the level 5 from the larger corridors that housing is still going to be built on west lake as we say its not going to be built but if it is built and they do it under these relaxed compatibility opportunities then they can do more so unless we are going to say nobody can live as close to the highway as x distance  in other areas theyre beyond an access road and then theres green space and then its up a hill its different  in almost every instance so for me the question is are we actually saying we dont want anybody to live on these parcels and i dont think were saying that so i dont understand why we would remove the highways where the projects are going to be   33602 pm  built we need to capture the additional density in those areas because its going to be built there   mayor adler council member fuentes   fuentes thank you i wanted to ask staff if you all would care to comment on potentially striking the asmp level 5 streets im just curious what this would potentially do for any of the additional usage we would get out of any of our vmu 2 or any   by waving the compatibility standards im trying to understand the lens of proposal that we have before us with item 66 what this could do on realizing the full potential   im fairly certain we wouldnt have vmu along highways right now maybe we should start with sam   kitchen this is broader than   33705 pm  vmu   right this is sam we have substantial amount of analysis done related to vmu right now the other propertys that might be implicated weve not conducted a significant amount of research but to the other point i would say that there are vmu parcels that are along asmp level 5 streets due to the way that the neighborhood optin optout process initially played out where core transit corridors were the starting point and some neighborhoods also elected off of highways like ben while boulevard and 183 to put vmu zoning there and so there are still some vmu zoned properties that are along asmp level 5 streets at this time but i dont have data to speak to the implication of removing that on other broader proposals at this time   fuentes im certainly intrigued by this proposal so i   33806 pm  certainly want to give it more consideration i thank you for bringing it forward    harpermadison i just wanted to offer additional clarification i was not saying lets strike the opportunity to produce housing anywhere i think we should consider it everywhere what i was saying was what we incentivize id like us to be more focused and make a priority of us incentivizing transit near  housing near transit corridors id like for us to take into consideration the implications of not doing so i was saying more what we incentivize as opposed to what we allow i think us relaxing parking requirements and transit centric neighborhoods makes way more sense than  i mean the parking requirements are lower for i35 than they are for middle city neighborhoods   33906 pm  and that doesnt make sense to me in which case i think there are other ways for us to accomplish our combined collective mutual goals   mayor adler okay   were trying to do some onthefly comparison of maps and are looking at imagine austin corridors and the transit priority network we dont have anything definitive right now but based on a very very quick look while you all were talking you might want to consider both rather than one or the other maybe just because there are imagine austin corridors that are not on the transit priority network so we could maybe do some   34008 pm  screenshots of maps i think it might be helpful to have you all maybe see where these are because i think its really  like i dont know what roads are on the different you know clumps that were talking about so i think it could be helpful   harpermadison i think thats a valid point what glens computer was hollering out earlier was that a member of our staff was pointing out that duval for example one the ncdd and two just because of how close the houses are it wouldnt even apply some of the compatibility regulations wouldnt apply there i do think that map would be helpful and i also think  i cant remember which  i think it was mayor pro tem alter asked about specific streets i think all of that would be very helpful   mayor adler we need to think through this carefully ill tell you i came into this   34110 pm  with a bent to try to do everything i could to increase housing supply so part of me doesnt want to consider something that takes away housing option we also talked about housing options and weve  asked staff to come back with an ordinance that does that theres got to be commercial uses along highways and if were trying to open up opportunities for residential and theres many different places as we can we want to do that there too so i guess im not ready to start changing the policies with respect to opening up housing opportunities yet for highway stuff but maybe a longerterm or future conversation about whether or not we want to discourage that but probably where i come downright flow is im not ready   i want to create housing opportunities wherever i can because thats our greater harm and risk at this point   34211 pm  i want to think through it because i havent had a chance to think through it yet   pool i just wanted to add to that mayor that theres also   it looks like we almost  we also might be looking at eliminating support for tax credit projects along level 5 streets and we dont want to do that so we need to be really cognizant of what it is were proposing i dont want to lose opportunities for tax credit projects thank you   tovo i think for me im going to need to see a list of the streets i think that may have been  im not sure council member harpermadison if thats what you were saying the specific streets with the amount of work we have between here and thursday im just going to need to see a list of streets please for the transit priority network that would not be incorporated in the others and are not listed as exceptions i guess that the question youve both changed it to   34316 pm  transit priority network would that be in combination with the same streets that are called out as exceptions in the proposal that the working group came forward with or is that intended to override the exceptions that are called out   vela i would like to add the transit priority network list to the other ones that were mentioned theres a lot of overlap but the transit priority network is a little broader than the other list   mayor adler mayor pro tem   tovo can i just ask with the exceptions as noted within the working group proposal or no exceptions as noted in the working group proposal because i think that is  my sense is that that is  thats the substance of the difference between whats been identified in the working group proposal and what youre suggesting with the transit priority network    vela im sorry council member tovo you have to remind me which exceptions were in the working group proposal   34417 pm   tovo there are a list of streets that are called out from those broader categories   alter i think youre exactly right as i recall the list where we had where we were clarifying that they were accepted a lot of those streets that were in the transit priority network that were not imagine austin corridors or bond corridors that were the subject of high level discussion and where we had observed that there were differences on the way to those streets that separated them from the things that we were calling out as medium corridors things like duval and speedway would be in the transportation network but would not be considered medium corridors in the proposal that we are putting forward and there is a list of streets that was in the original proposal which is available on   34517 pm  the message board we went through quite a lot of discussion in our group to land on the subset of streets that we did recognizing the many conversations that we had during codenext in the development code and how all those had played out and trying to get something done where we could actually accomplish something and move forward with it in a way that would be relatively simple to do   tovo i had asked about how her amendment interacts with the list but youve called my attention to something that i had overlooked which is that theres no longer a list in what youre bringing forward of streets that are accepted so is the intent that this resolution is  has an attachment that is your proposal or is that now not part of your proposal that youre bringing   34620 pm  forward that there are no streets being culled out from the medium and large   alter well there are streets that are not medium or large because they dont fall under the definition so we chose to put  we close to use a resolution format rather than an exhibit but by the definition that we have those streets are accepted because theyre not imagine austin theyre not bond corridors   mayor adler so the list was    a list of streets that we did not think fell within the street categories we had identified unless there be any question for the community we had prepared a list of streets that were subject to a lot of controversy in earlier versions that were not part of the street categories   34724 pm  it was suggested we didnt need that because they werent otherwise covered i dont have a problem with specifically identifying the streets that are not covered however we do it because i think its good to be able to tell people the street is not part of that   tovo i apologize that im only now noticing the list of streets is gone i think that is helpful to have in there   kitchen mayor i have to    renteria the fire department holds back more affordable housing because of their setback requirements and thats another one thats really affecting affordable housing especially in my district a lot of commercial in my area and i try to build a unit  and   34827 pm  the fire department said no because they have propane tanks up there to charge up their little lifters little motorized so if were really going to start looking at compatibility about highways and all that lets also look at the compatibility setback thats required by the fire department   mayor adler okay council member kitchen   kitchen well i do appreciate the effort that everyone has made i know the working group is trying really hard to move this forward i just would like to suggest that the rationale for keeping the highways is a good rationale but to be consistent wed also need to do the transit priority network it doesnt seem like its treating the whole city the same to include highways but then say were not going to include the transit priority network or not going to include   34927 pm  certain streets were not looking at problematic streets for the whole city so im much more comfortable tying this to whatever the appropriate rationale is and being consistent with doing that   mayor adler any further conversation    harpermadison well i didnt respond to council member tovos question but i think in large part just gave my response im thinking from a land use policy perspective from a policy perspective i think compatibility should speak to the various needs not necessarily that list of streets so in my minds eye it wasnt in the resolution so i wasnt considering the list as something to take into consideration i was thinking broad policy i just want to be able to put ourselves in a position to make some more policy i thought smart policy would   35029 pm  allow for all the exceptions to speak for themselves by way of our compatibility requirements so that was to answer your question about the streets   mayor adler and i would just add that having gone through this process as we have for the last eight years the purpose of this exercise is we identified it back in november is to try to find where the venn diagrams crossed and where we would have kind of agreement youve seen with street selection just a tiny piece of the conversations on streets that weve had the last eight years and if we end up with a discussion about streets that will be 50 of what it is that we talk about so part of the process was trying to get us the big things done and not necessarily get all the individual streets right but to enable us to move forward and then we can edit it or do better i mean theres a lot of things that this represents that i do not think represent the best policy decision   35132 pm  they just dont but im interested in trying to get something done that we can put in place that will survive while you all remaining on council go forth and do great things all right anything else before we go to the next one   tovo just super quickly i think transit priority corridors are going to be a difficulty for me and i say that as somebody who has frontage of highways as well these all impact my district and i will have so give some thought council member harper madison to what you said about compatibility in the highways and removaling level 5harpermadison to what you said about compatibility in the highways and removaling level 5 i would suggest if we do have that conversation or if the future council does to go back and think about housing on highways i think we should also reevaluate what has started to become a council trend of approving housing on industrial tracks sometimes in the middle of industrially zoned areas   35234 pm   with industrial uses close nearby which there have been several council decisions in that regard secondly i just wanted to mention i will have some amendments and i dont know that theyll be out tomorrow theres just a tremendous amount on the agenda that impacts district 9 that im working on but i do intend to bring forward some amendments related to providing some modeling and visual illustrations and i appreciate the staff doing what you have done i think those have been very useful but i have gotten lots of requests from constituents for kind of 3d modeling and simple visualizations that really take some model tracks and show us how this would look up in different parts of the city so those are some of the kinds of amendments that i intend to bring forward   mayor adler okay thank you   tovo and there are some others but ill share those    mayor adler anything you want to daylight now thats helpful   tovo not today   35335 pm  if i find them quickly before we move on ill mention them   mayor adler okay lets move on to the next one the next one we had pulled was item 80 vmu 2 council member kitchen pulled it shes not with us now having made the election to have the homelessness thing come up at 100 first but maybe we can have a conversation about it that shell be able to go back and take a look at if anybody wants to address issues on vmu 2 i will say for me having vmu 2 by right as we laid out last fall and as the staff came back is real important to me i think that is the lowest barrier for people being able to step in and make use of it if it is a zoning place or it has to go to planning commission   35440 pm  i just think that we just wont see but a few of these cases so having it by right just remains real important to me but i also recognize that if were going to make it by right which is probably the most important thing for me then i recognize that well lose support for doing it by right if we go too far on changing compatibility questions so for me im comfortable using the same compatibility that were agreeing to in 66 as the compatibility that ultimately the vmu 2 properties would be associated with and it still does really good work i would urge everybody to take a look at that page 14 that the staff pulled out for us   35544 pm   and noting that the 100foot distance enabling 60 feet at 100 feet on the base vmu is as good as it can get because vmu doesnt allow anything greater than 60 feet so compatibility for greater height after that doesnt really change anything because there isnt vmu height greater than 60 feet so that gets us to where it is we need to get to and then on vmu 2 the difference between even saying on the bonus a difference between 90 feet 200 feet and 90 feet at 100 feet is only an 18 delta and that 18 is real  is 18 i mean its real numbers but i would prioritize making it by right in all kind of vmu and   35646 pm  all kinds of situations just because i think that will end up with it being used so many more times i wanted to say that out loud in case ann watches the videos later thats where i am thank you anybody else want to say anything about vmu 2   it has all been said   mayor adler all been said   vela i think just lowering the compatibility along the orange and blue lines is the lowest of low hanging fruit it reinforces our now multibilliondollar investment in project connect it starts that virtuous cycle of getting people along a light rail line also the parking requirements   you know if were not   35747 pm  prepared as council to you know substantially reduce that compatibility specifically focused along the orange and and on the flip side of it i think that by focusing on the orange and blue lines in terms of vmu in terms of compatibility and parking we are sending a very strong signal to the federal government and department of transportation that we are serious about our transit investment and i think that will help our secure additional federal funding maximize the amount of federal funding that we are going to get so i guess i dont see it as an either or kind of situation you know i think we can do both i mean i think we need a broader adjustment of compatibility and i appreciate the working groups proposal and   35848 pm  i look forward to talking about it but with regard to the light rail lines i do think we have to go above and beyond what the working group is proposing on that too    mayor adler and if we can get that without giving up by right from a policy standpoint is something i support for all of the reasons that you gave but ultimately we need to  for right for all of the vmu places that are both on and off the blue line because then they get picked up by item 66 and we dont want those tracks that will be enhanced by a 66 have to go through the zoning case so i agree with you from a policy standpoint if there is the broader consensus to be able to do that on the blue and orange line as you make that appeal and still have it by right i would be interested in   35949 pm  knowing if there is a consensus to do that   vela thank you mayor and i would support by right i would support that as well and there is a lot of passion in this   mayor adler thank you yes councilmember tovo okay we are ready to move on to the next item okay next item tote   tovo and a thats the homelessness briefing i meant to ask the question and feel free to get back to us when you need to but when is the downtown austin community court coming back to us   thank you staff    tovo thank you can i say thank you for butting the q  a that is relevant to this issue al together that was super super helpful in addition to the other materials but that was really    and we will try to identify those other times where that would be helpful to you even in our working  in the discussion there were previous   40049 pm  budgets that maybe we can file and make sure those are accessible to council   tovo thank you   i have seen a draft of some of the  i asked the staff to continue doing some work and i think there should be a memo update to council in the coming weeks and then there would be a discussion scheduled for work session a essentially that last week in july so i will check on that and make sure that i have those dates right but i know there has been an update memo that was circulating and we are in the process of final lieferg that   tovo and that those stakeholder conversations have happened and have fit into the memo and the memo is coming to us so we would be poised for conversation in july   correct    tovo great thank you   mayor adler and i missed the beginning of what you said   tovo i wanted to make sure it was on a path to coming back   mayor adler thank you yes mayor pro tem   this is for other agenda item this is for other agenda   40151 pm  item comments   mayor adler go ahead   so i wanted to thank councilmember tovo for bringing item 67 about the halo cameras on sixth street forward and i wanted to happened i want to be added as a cosponsor is that okay clerk and then i wanted to flag for councilmember ellis that i will have what i hope will be a friendly amendment for 59 that will be acknowledging the electrification of transportation resolution that we have in the work that is supposed to be underway related to that which relates directly to the he bike e bike stuff and we hope to have that up as soon as possible but i think it is mostly a whereas clause in there so it should be friendly hopefully thank you   that sounds great and i look forward to seeing it   mayor adler councilmember kitchen said that because she wasnt here for the discussion   40253 pm  on number 80 she had a question or two she had questions and was going to post them on the message board so everybody should make sure that we go there to go look at that yes councilmember fuentes   fuentes thank you i also wanted to flag for councilmember ellis that i will bring forth what i hope to be a friendly amendment to the e bike resolution just looking at adding some equity in how we build out our infrastructure related to e bikes particularly around the stations throughout the city a and so we will be sure to share that amendment with you once it is ready   mayor adler cool anything else that people want to talk about before we go to executive session yes councilmember harpermadison   harpermadison i thought we were bringing up the conversation on hopelessness and   i guess not there was a specific thing councilmember tovo was going to ask one thing i want to ask and this certainly can be something we discuss moving forward is what    40355 pm  are our options for just removing every single barrier there may be to producing the housing for homelessness housing permanent supportive housing i just have questions about how do we just make every barrier go away   mayor adler you are talking about development services   i am and you dont have to answer that question right now it is just something that occurred to me as we were having that conversation and then i was at a luncheon today you know where builders and folks in that arena were talking about construction costs labor costs which made us think about the earlier conversation with the labor folks and just you know how all of those things matter in the end including when you are to produce  so just i mean i obviously would like for that to extend to residential as well   mayor adler roderick can we do that can we prioritize deeply affordable housing coc housing   projects   sure just a couple of things there are two council resolution   40455 pm  that are pertinent to this discussion or councilmember requests the first request is a report from dsd on processing time frames and just so in the context of permitting and so that is in the works and should be coming to council very soon and the other resolution is to develop some sort of prioritized aspect for permanent supporting housing projects and we have worked with the homeless services office as well as housing and planning  to develop a recommendation and so that will be coming to council as well at the heart of it of course when you see this of course that we want to do is target those permits supportive housing projects that have a good quantity of psh that also have the wrap around services and so that is where a our concern lies so that way it is not one or two within the complex of 300 but rather a good quantity if you will of psh that the whole summarize can benefit from so we are coming guard with that information to council   mayor adler okay   40556 pm  and i think at this point the housing folks the homelessness folks diana can tell you exactly what projects are that constitute the 1300 units that we are hoping come online    exactly   mayor adler and helping people in the next three years and i think that while there could certainly be addition later we know what those projects are   exactly and thats why we are working with the homeless services office is because they know those projects and those are the ones we do want to prioritize and then also there is a third piece and that dsd add add position in the current budget year positioned specifically to help our affordable housing projects in general get through the process faster so these are  this is an individual who helps to bird dog any issues that arise during the application process so that way they can make process smoother for affordable housing projects   which i really appreciate that i think i was thinking specifically more radical just   40657 pm  entire   laughter   any barrier whatsoever if it is for permanent supportive housing and homelessness housing and affordable housing  just no barriers whatsoever i realize as the stretch but thats what i was looking for   it is a long discussion because at the heart of it is we have got a lot of regulations that apply and we cant sidestep those regulations we have to enforce those those are ordinances and so it takes of course staff time to review those to ensure that these projects are fully compliant and not every application meets the ordinance as it should so therein lies the discussion is when an application doesnt meet the ordinance to catch it and they send it back to the applicants and say sorry but you do not meet the ordinance and so that is unfortunate and you know it is a process between the applicant and the staff slow process and staffs charge is very important we have to enforce these regulations we cannot allow any project not to do that   mayor adler but to that end recognizing the importance   40758 pm  and the existential nature of what we are dealing with here for the citys survival if we should change some ordinances with respect to these kind of properties if they are getting hung up in a place and say everybody is getting hung up on this one change this ordinance if this is where  i dont think the priority that the council has with respect to getting these things done fast and faster than fast is being reflected and  dont feel bound by an ordinance say do you want to change this ordinance or if it is a staffing issue or if it is a prioritization issue if it is more people i mean we are trying to figure out to  how do we take a year off the process because if we can get these units up a year early from what we are being told from the developers is that you know if we have a threeyear rose and a year and a half of it is taken up in development process with the city so if we have meetings every monday and we brought in all of this the department heads and everybody was working on the   40859 pm  applications at the same time or we helped people get through their applications so they didnt have to go back and forth as much i mean    and i totally understand that a lot of these regulations are rooted in 0 council policy and so therein lies    mayor adler bring it back to us we are saying if you cant get them out a year earlier dont feel like you are bound to anything give us the opportunity to be able to make changes so we can get these things online a year faster thats what we are asking for   absolutely   mayor    mayor adler yes   02 i would say that doesnt extend to health and safety of occupants for workers who might be on the site who are doing the building i mean it is one thing to do away with everything we wipe everything out and then there are no protections   mayor adler i wasnt saying we were going to  i wasnt saying wipe it all out   no that is what  some of the conversation was how do we eliminate all of the ordinances and regulations and the bars and the barriers and i am saying that question we also have to acknowledge that there are reasons for some of them and i   41001 pm  dont think any of us spend to be saying that we would do away with health and safety and with protection    mayor adler no no they are all important   they are all important and they are there for a reason   mayor adler i just wanted to come back and say do you want to speed this up by five months this is a change you would make and the council could look at it and say well we are clearly not going to make that change    and we may need to make sure we are not sending a signal to anybody in the community that we are contemplating even looking at eliminating every single ordinance in order to have things just get built then it is all tickytacky and doesnt last and there are all kinds of issues   mayor adler no one is proposing that   that is excellent i know i would not be  didnt think that was really what was being said here i wanted to confirm that and firm that up   mayor adler   excellent thank you all   mayor adler all right it is 410 we are going to add scrowrp this meeting at 415 lets see if we can get into executive session   so we are not adjourning   mayor adler what   41101 pm   we are recessing   mayor adler we are recessing yes sorry recessing so we can go into executive session and in that regard  virtual it has to be virtual we are now going to go to closed session to take up four items pursuant to the government code whether he discuss personnel matters related to items e1 2 3 4 which are performance compensation benefits for the city clerk city auditor municipal court clerk and the manager without objection here at 411 we will two into executive

believe  lets see r we beginning with an introduction from our staff are we beginning with our speakers lets invite our speakers up and if you would please introduce yourself as you come up   93612 am     hi good morning the  chair good morning and thank you for shifting from last week to this week we appreciate it  yes of course so i am kate gross i cant any with the harm reduction alliance and this is paulette good morning i am paulette with the harm reduction alliance i am the organizing director  and i think we were invited here to talk to you about the overdose crisis that we are in the midst of as a community we held a town hall last month to discuss what we feel like is a public health emergency and then the county recently passed their declaration around the public health crisis related to overdose deaths so i think our briefing today is going to talk through a little bit about who we are why we are here what is going on with overdoses and in our community right now and some strategies both short term and longterm strategies that we need to be   93715 am  looking at shall we just go through the slides i dont know how do we do that do we do it  chair you can ask you can ask the staff to advance the slides next slide  you can keep going through until we get to the pr presentation  next one so this is our agenda for today go we have a a time limit how much time are we allotted okay  i am sorry vice chair i dont think your mic was on  chair there is not a time certain or time limit for their presentation  i think we had talked with the speakers about an estimated time does 15 minutes work for you  yes  about 15 minutes so we preserve enough time for q  a but certainly if you need more time we can do that  no it will be a shorter presentation to make sure there is time for discussion okay next slide   93816 am  so just to start and i know that you all have looked at this issue many times over the years so i hope you know most of this but it is important for us to start with the war in drugs to kind of shern the cry can sister that we are in right now one of the things wait to emphasize is that although we tend to kind of look at individual choices when it drops overdose and drug use it is really a system level problem that is fueled by criminalization and the war on drugs and we have spent so much money on the war on drugs as a nation and as a community over the last 50 years really targeting black and brown communities poor communities and it has done nothing to curb drug use so all those resources the violence that has come this the nation name of the war on drugs has led us to where we are now in the worst overdose crisis we have seen and really the war on drugs we consider a human rights disaster not only for the violence it has   93919 am   caused in communities but also because of you know all its impacts beyond the immediate city of arrests and incarceration and violence so criminal history affects education healthcare housing immigration employment everything and so what the war on drugs has done is it hasnt curbed drug use but it has deeply destabilized the peoples lives driving people in poverty tearing apart families people blues their housing their jobs their income over the war on drugs and so both criminalization and the elicit drug supply and how that becomes increasingly  it is unrecollected and becomes increasingly dangerous plus this destabilization of peoples lives together has kind of put us in a position that we are here to talk with you all about today so when we talk about solutions we have to keep that in mind if   94020 am  we actually want to make a difference in what is happening on the ground right now next slide  thankfully the harm reduction movement has a lot of alternative ways of addressing drug use a it is kind of  i think about it as an antidote to the war on drugs in harm reduction we talk about it as a practice but it is also a social movement born out of the aids crisis led by directly impacted people who are dying really created harm reduction movement to keep people alive and take care of each other and so it focuses on reducing the risks associated with drug use keeping people alive and also is a social justice movement that really centers the rights and dignity respect for people who use drugs because in our society we have decided that people who use drugs are bad and we do not seem to care about   94121 am  keeping them alive in fact we funnel them towards death and thats what we are seeing right now with this overdose crisis i think you all know a little bit about harm reduction i know i presented before we are going to get into the texas harm reduction alliance in a minute but i think you all may have worked with the austin harm reduction the coalition years ago next slide but some of the common strategies around harm reduction look like syringe access so making sure people have access to a sterile search ring when they are injecting drugs  making sure they have a safe nice dispose of their used syringes and another common strategies is medication assisted treatment which i think might have been why central health was invited but is a vaccination zone norphine is one common medication and so is methadone but they look different in our community and they are regulated differently  another big one i am sure you   94222 am   all are aware of is naah locks stone and naah locks shown the overdose reversal medication  would care is harm reduction right in so for folks who are injecting drugs primarily naloxone the wounds incur can lead into carditis and hospitalization and death and so wound care is extremely important on the front end to keep people healthy safer use education there is really when we think about prevention and drug education this is really important because similar to sex education we understand that kind of abstinence only models are not working we have to arm people with good information about drugs and how to use them more safely so that they stay alive and so that is a harm reduction strategy which drugs dont you mix how do you use with a buddy so that you are not alone if you do overdose things like that drug testing is a big one   94323 am  i am a sure you have heard about fentanyl testing strips right with the drug supply infused with fentanyl at the moment  fentanyl testing strips has been a big topic of conversation it is just one tool in our drug testing our  we can do much more comprehensive drug testing so people know not only if fentanyl is present but how much and what other drugs may be present and this is important as the drug supply will begin to shift right which is what happens when we focus on one particular substance with our policies the drug supply shifts and we see a new substances pop up and then safer consumption spaces for overdose prevention centers which is where people can use safely under observation with access to save equipment and connection to support and resources if they want it which is something  i know you know not always welcome to talk about things that are happening   94424 am  in other parts of the country but in the emergency situation we are in right now with the overdose crisis we have to look at communities that are implementing strategies that are working and we see these programs working in places like new york where they have saved over 300 lives to date and they have only been open for six months next slide just to be clear on the evidence harm reduction strategies are supported with lots of evidence we see syringe access is critical to reducing hiv and hepc infections  and we also see that syringe service programs and harm reduction programs are an important point of entry into care not just drugrelated care but all types of care because harm reduction programs by their nature are low bear we are like no barrier   94527 am  programs a folks who dont normally access mainstream services are going to utilize a syringe service program and they are five times more likely to enter treatment than folks who are not engaged in those types of programs thats what the research shows in other places next slide so a little bit about us and  what we do i hope you all knew about the austin harm reduction coalition that was here in our community for 20 plus years we are a different organization we formed in 2019 so we are newer but we were founded by members of the austin harm reduction coalition we have a robust harm reduction program we have a dropin center now it is the only drop in center we have now for people who are actively using we have an outreach team and you can see our mobile clinic there in the photo thats a brand new mobile clinic through a grant from austin public health so we will be increasing the   94629 am  services we can provide out in the community which is a big piece of harm reduction you have to meet people where they are at we also do local and state level advocacy because there are many barriers to providing comprehensive harm reduction in texas so we know we have to change laws in order to expand access and we also train on what harm reduction is and how to implement it in your program we know we have 0 teach service providers and other leaders in our community how to do harm reduction if it is going to make a difference for people who are directly impacted who are entering those programs and we will talk a little bit more about that i think later next slide right so i just want to acknowledge that we were in a part of this work that you all did in 2018 to look at the opioid crisis other leaders in our community were but we wanted to bring this into the conversation because we know   94730 am  you looked into this as a problem four years ago and here we are in the worst crisis we have seen so what lessons can we learn from what you all put in place then and how can we do things differently this time around we dont want to pass another resolution that doesnt make a difference in saving peoples lives and maybe this can be a part of the discussion since we werent a part of this resolution we would love to hear kind of what came out of it or where you get like you fell short  paulette is going to kind of talk about the context we are in right now and what we are working on  so i think everyone here has been seeing some of the horrific headlines every single day that come out about rising overdose deaths across the country austin travis county is no different the latest data that came outlast month a week after we held our town hall showed that   94833 am  overdoses had risen once again in 2021 alarm part of that was fentanyl related overdose deaths which jumped by 237 percent in photographs county and so just to put it more into context drug fox i see the i have now the number one cause of death accidentally deaths in travis county ahead of fall and motor vehicle fatalities i think when we are talking about the overdose crisis something that we often  that we dont name and sometimes the news doesnt name is that this is sodrel linked to our homelessness crisis in austin and so while overdose deaths are recognizing our homelessness crisis has continued to rage on and people are subsequent deeper and deep never places where they are not connected to their networks place that is are harder for us to make sure that we are able to serve them and other organizations like ours   94934 am  the last data that we had on the homelessness point in time number was 3160 people but we know that that number is much larger than that and lastly all of the state and local data predictions and predictions even from the cdc show that 2021  or 2022 is going to be even deadlier than 2021 so there is several issues impacting overdose deaths as i mentioned a total lack of housing for people experiencing homelessness and also revolving door i think as affordability becomes less and less available in terms of house fog are people people are losing their housing and this is driving driving the continued overdose continued camp sweeps as i mentioned is   95034 am  one of the worst things that can be happening to people who are using drugs and are experiencing homelessness you get further away from their networks they are losing all of their belongings there a general lack of harm reduction training and expertise in service providers so we speak so often to our participants at thra and they often point out how not only are they treated with dignity and respect and compassion in our dropin center but we also are understanding drug use not through the lens of like abstinence based we are understanding how to train and educate people who are using drugs and i think a lot of  a lot of service providers around the city are not trained in harm reduction and in particular shelter providers the hotels and this is somethingly talk about in a second but as we are talking about more supportive housing units coming online in the future this is a really really key area that we really need to   95135 am  work on ensuring that service providers are trained in harm reduction and are adopting those values another part is  methadone this has been an ongoing topic in austin paragraphs county people who are ready to access methadone sometimes have to wait six seven eight nine months which is just unacceptable health professionals are not utilizing harm reduction approaches there is a methadone clinic right near our office where we heard from several of our participants that use that methadone clinic that doctors there will if someone misses an appointment they will be dropped from their regular doses to very low amounts that causes so much distress in somebodys body and entire life and them  lastly the criminalization of substance use and poverty so whether that is embodied through the continued   95238 am  sweeps or harassment of folks around the community who are poor and using drugs next so immediate needs number one and something that we tried to identify through the countys resolution that was passed a couple of weeks ago we need to be working towards building a robust harm reduction infrastructure in austin so what we mean by that is that we need more peer delivered harm reduction services that go beyond thra there are many service providers that are ready and willing to take on some of this work and work with us to be trained and coordinated with us so navigation center the other one is foundation and sunrise are two that we have been working really closely with who have been doing some of this harm reduction work but need need more support to do it well and so we dont want to be the only   95340 am  dropin center and the only harm reduction center in the city we need much more than thra expanding access to no objection than and narcan is another piece n the last month  there were a lot of what we passed through resolution the funding is going to go towards access to narcan and the reason that is because there is a lot of service providers dont even have narcan and service providers need to have it but so do libraries so do first responders the parks department there is many gaps in need and really everybody should have access to narcan it is an authorized tool that saves lives next is requiring agencies to making a go ahead data relevant to the overdose crisis available so really to understand the over toes crisis we need to have data about drug related arrests   95442 am  emergency calls homelessness the number of sweeps that are happening across the city there is a long list of folks who are discharged from programs is a big one harm reduction and treatment we talked about the methadone piece all of that information we need to start kind of gathering right now to do some immediate response around the urgent needs and really to be building toward future solutions as well stopping the sweeps so i mentioned this already twice i think there is a huge huge need if we are going to really address the overdose crisis we need to stop the sweeps and we have to increase access to housing which is the next bullet identifying and increasing capacity for harm reduction strategies and new housing developments and shelters and    95545 am  transitional hotels we cant dont see people being discharged from southbridge and northbridge hotels because they are accused or even because they are using drugs we cant continue to see service providers not understanding how to support people who are rug drugs or formerly using drugs we really need to be training and using models that have worked around the country in bringing them here and bringing them here and we have allies around the country that are willing to do that so thats something that we have been working open and talking about another piece intentional spaces for community led discussions on needs and resolution solutions this is why we held the town hall we really needed to be in front of decision makers our community members needed to speak about what the urgent needs are and we had really had a hard time doing that in a   95649 am  meaningful way so creating a space to do that is important and we saw that in the countys resolution we were able to get a standing agenda item in the commissioners court and then lastly imposing criminal penalties on those who possess or sell fentanyl across the country and in this state the knee jerk reaction and  is to criminalize the selling or possession of fentanyl and over 50 years of the war on drugs has shown us that criminalization of substances just causes more toxic drug supply and it does not get at the issues of rising overdose deaths and everything associated to it longer term needs syringe program authorization texas does not  we have one pilot in san antonio right now authorizing syringe services and   95750 am  so we really need to change  we need to change this at a state level but we need all of you alls help to do that as well diverse housing options that meet the needs of current and former drug users supportive housing cant just be a model for folks who are ready and i put this in quotation ready for housing everybody is ready for housing and we need to be able to meet everybodys diverse needs whether they are using drugs or formerly used drugs and if they are not using drugs at all service providers should be trained in and embrace harm reduction values and strategies again this is going to take a real cultural shift and a lot of training and education to move us beyond this like abstinence based punitive models and there is a lot of resources outside of  outside of austin and across the country that show that this can be done in a real way   95853 am   lastly or the last two are around safe supply what we mean by a safe supply and this is something that is being talked about across the country and has been for a long time is exactly that that push around we cant just target the use of fentanyl or any other substance we have to be moving towards pa safe supply where people who are going to be using drugs know what they are using and if that is not the direction we are moving in we are always going to be living in this constant overdose crisis and lastly overdose prevention centers which kate mentioned these are  there are a couple of pilots in new york we were able to visit as a all of our staff went up to new york about a month ago and really just like this amazing these amazing service providers who are running the first overdose prevention centers in the   95953 am  country but these have existed for a long time outside of the united states and so and really they existed without authorization in a lot of parts of the united states so we as a city and as a state need to be moving towards these bold solutions and sometimes that means that the law will have to change and the law will have to be broken and the harm reduction movement has always had to  had to break law in order to change the law and move in the direction that we need to be going in so those are some of the longterm needs and i believe  and we add add few resources national harm reduction coalition has some good  some food handouts on just the various harm reduction issues so you will see in there some handouts around safe consumption sites fentanyl discussion   100054 am  points and various other things and then a handout around homelessness and harm reduction and where we need to go to make sure service providers that are  that deal with the homeless population are moving toward home reduction and dea drug policy alliance another key ally of ours has put out many many resources but one a few are on policing the drug war one important one is on drug education resources so during our conversations with the commissioners court a lot of the questions that came up was around drug education for young people and there is a way to do do this that isnt just based on harm  in abstinence and this is just one limping that shows some of the ways to have conversations as educators parents and young adults and then lastly is a link to a handout around rethinking the drug dealer rethinking how we criminalize further criminalize people his drug   100155 am  dealers drug dealers of fentanyl et cetera with that   chair thank you thank you both so very very much thank you that you i think you provided us with a lot of context and a lot of good information colleagues are you able to stay for a bit  yes  chair that would be  what i would suggest now in the interest of time we are going to lose the mayor here soon and we have two pieces  of this discussion here today one is the presentation we just heard from the texas harm reduction coalition we also have asked our staff to be here to also talk about the response to the mayor as  the resolution that the mayor brought in 2018 and since we are losing the mayor soon what i would ask is we hold specific questions at this point and invite dr pa chet up to talk to us about what has happened since 2018 first i am going to invite the mayor to just very briefly and you are welcome to sit down   100255 am  and call you if you would like to grab a seat at the table rights before or wherever you are most comfortable and we will invite you back up here just in a second as we are  and we will entertain questions on both pieces mayor would you just like to set a few minutes laying out the resolution i know you have distributed it here on the dais along with the responsive memo and if you could kind of summarize the direction and the next steps that we are that were identified in there and then invite dr pa chet to talk about the work  chair  chair yes  this is great i am really going to  i am really appreciating hearing this because i know it is something the city has been working on and the mayor initiated in previous years so this is very helpful i think it is also important to state that we have another resolution a that we might also want councilmember fuentes to speak to so that we are speaking to both of those resolutions  chair absolutely and i think we are posted to do that as well but lets go in chronological order if thats   100356 am  all right so we will start with the resolution that mayor did and what work the staff have done and as i understand councilmember fuentes your resolution picks up on next steps that respond to the texas harm reduction coalition so i think thats the chronology we are kind of following here but we will start with questions and then ask councilmember fuentes to lay those out i am just trying to maximize the amount of time we have here with the player and others before we start to lose our quorum the  mayor adler and i appreciate that and first i want to appreciate the work of this committee on this issue and certainly the leadership of councilmember fuentes in resurfacing this issue and giving it the urgency the sense of urgency i think that is otherwise lacking so thank you for your leadership in doing that this was a challenge that wasnt hitting our city at the same level as it was hitting many other cities across the country if you will go back   100458 am  historically certainly in in kind of the rust belt parts of the country and then spreading but we did raise the issue back four years ago in 2018 because it was beginning to reach crisis levels and it appeared as if focused or concentrated in a lot of the music and arts communities initially in our city so as a council  we passed that resolution to 180524038 and i have asked the staff to put that into backup in this item so that someone going through this meeting can find it in item number 3 as well as the response and basically this was a resolution from the council saying hey this is a growing concern what should we be doing about it a special focus in music and arts community but more generally we need to do something staff in response to that convened what appeared to be a   100559 am  really large group of folks that responded to the growing substance abuse crisis multidisciplinary collaborated and coordinated response and listed a lot of different organizations both specifically and generally and then talked about next steps in terms of partnership recommendations of harm reduction treatment and recovery as well as outcome measures and data but obviously it has progressed and the challenges progressed and i think it is important for us to find out what it is that has been done maybe take a look at what it was we intended to do and a see if we in fact did those things and if we didnt how we filled the gaps the presentation that we saw today from a harm reduction alliance i appreciate that and that contained a lot more specificity than was in the staff response so i hope we do the backup   100700 am  thank you  great thank you mayor and thank you for your leadership on that issue  okay good morning janet pa chet i am the chief epidemiologist of public austin health  and i kind of coordinated responded to the last resolution in 2018 under hayden who was our director at the time  we included austin harm reduction in our initial  enter disciplinary group we brought together to kind of hash out and identify what the issues were i think a lot of those discussions were focused around data and trying to paint the picture of what our experience was here in the austin travis county community so that we could apply for federal funding when available and we had a good solid   100801 am  scientific basis for some of the data that we were presenting since that time since august of 2018 which is when we did the resolution austin public health had participated in  a fairly extensive needs assessment so one of the major things that we worked on in that  this 2019 and i can share in with you we did a needs assessment and this was in participation with austin integral care or at the time integral care central health and travis county health  human services and the sobering center you know one of our recommendations was not to just solely focus on opioids but other substances because the medical examiners data was showing that a lot of desks were using multiple drugs or alcohol in combination when they were identifying overdose deaths so we came together as a group    100902 am  and part of the purpose of this needs assessment was to try to really get our arms around how widespread or what services and support existed in austin and travis county you know what different planning groups are because there was a lot of good that is happening out in our community but people are operating in silos so we are trying to get an idea and capture all of the folks that were actually participating in this space so we lost we also wanted to see are there overlaps in service delivery and other services they were providing and wanted to try to also get an inventory  inventory of what type of substance use or misuse are available to the community at large so this report was the shed in october of 2019 and it took a lot of work and there were a lot   101002 am  of people who participated in the service assessment and i can share this with you if you would like but in february of this 2019 we were notified by the sense for disease centers for disease control that we would   there was a federal funding opportunity available to austin public health or austin and travis county travis county and austin was listed as an eligible city the do receive federal funding for disease surveillance activities like main he looking at mortality data making sure that we were capturing and again beginning to payment the picture of what was going on working with several other communities there were 18 eligible communities that were in that funding opportunity however because of some flaws that they calculated that the center force disease  the centers for disease control and prevention calculated from mortality data and the estimates   101103 am  they used by the national center for health statistics they yanked that funding from several major metropolitan areas and i think most of the cities in the state of texas so we were one of the areas that had the hope of being able to get funded significantly to support this activity and then that funding was later pulled by cdc you know we  as the national association or cities and county health officials they have a big cities health coalition that  who wrote and lobbied to you know consider allowing the funding to happen based on this  mortality estimates so basically the mortality estimates werent showing we had enough overdose deaths when we know on our level that there are probably more deaths than what the cdc is reporting and there is also a major lag in the amount of mortality  like   101203 am   when we get mortality data there is typically a twoyear lag period based on when we get information so we are able to pull information from our medical examiner who has a bit of information and then our office of vital records who has death certificate data and that tends to be more timely we continue to monitor that data we have been doing that since 2018 and continue to do so and we will present that data in our indicators report when it comes out lets see you know we continue to explore other funding opportunities as well anywhere there might be a lead to funding we definitely are trying to see if there is funding available to our community so that we can get some data behind this and really paint the picture so that  so that we can get some of these   101304 am  prevention projects and harm reduction projects in place i know ems they were not able to be here today but they had one project that was also funded by the department of state health services it is what they called an intercept project so when they meet people their community health  can meet people you know at a counter what happens is they are able to try to get that person into the sobering center and link them to the proper care for recovery and that type of thing so that project was also funded by the department of health state health services the that there were some issues with how it came out so they continued to support the project through inkind support with  from the city could we shift to some of the   101404 am  specific again just in the interest of time we are going lose the mayor here at 1025  okay  chair i wonder if you could address some of the very specific actions that were in the resolution some of them have certainly happened the third  the third be it further resolved talked about the current lit gaition which has now concluded we entered the settlement i know councilmember fuentess resolution that is coming forward next week has some additional next steps on that you talked about collaboration  uh  chair some of the other steps i would be interested in you addressing are whether or not you brought forward funding requests i guess part of that maybe didnt happen because we had the hopes of this other funding source 0 there was discussion about staff recommendation considering without limitation increased epidemiological surveillance and monitoring of public education health promotion evidence based reduction harm reduction strategies criminal justice diversion increased funding for range of treatment and recovery   101507 am  and naah lacks own kits and other  best practices so if you could kind of address those i know for example you mentioned the sobering center one of the things that happened since its inception and  now is that the board that i serve on changed its practices and policies to allow folks who are intoxicated and possibly using intoxicated possibly through opioids or other kind of drugs to be admitted that was not original intent and that was a policy change that happened and thats i think our best example of the criminal justice diversion program it is my understanding the naloxone kits based on the office q  a that others my office  and others have put forward increased among the staff but can you address some of the other very specific points in the resolution just so we is a sense of kind of what   he try to do my best i know dr roxann fuente are on the line and since this is like covers a whole broad range of   101608 am  things   chair sure  my focus has always been on the data and  chair i would invite them to answer that if that is   and i will say that you know again a lot of these recommendations part of the challenge has been there hasnt been funding to support movement forward we have tried to move forward where possible like i said just trying to identify all of the resources that are available  and i dont know if you have a copy of this but i can share it with you if you would like  chair thank you you know what i would actually ask is if you could make that available to all of the committee members  sure  chair i think that would be appropriate and you know as we try to understand kind of what work got initiated what the response was what the work was i think it might be extremely useful councilmember fuentes to have all of this as backup to your item next week so i would request that we have that document you just shared the mayors resolution with the responsive memo and if our   101710 am  speakers from earlier are a men to believe this having their powerpoint as part of that work as well does that sound good  yes that sounds great thank you  chair thank you  so again from my perspective sparse epidemiologic surveillance and monitoring we continue to  we have been doing that since probably before the resolution original resolution occurred looking at death certificates and any deaths that are coming across through our office of vital records and we continue to  we have over time continued to find funding sources when they have been available we have worked with different groups from can the maternal and child health perspective generally for public at large and that type of thing i know from a prevention education standpoint i think you know boots on the ground ems their community health paramedic program has been sort of instrumental in doing some of   101810 am   the educational outreach and intervention at the street level for any of those individuals that are included i know stars harm reduction we did take what we heard from the town hall meeting  okay you want to go okay  good morning stephanie hayden howard assistant city manager  when we referenced the resolution itself there were two items that department was able to continue to move forward as jana stated we were able to increase the epidemiology portion and continue to monitor that information there continue to be conversations internally between ems austin public health and at the time the office of the chief   101911 am  medical officer ems was able to provide some naloxone to folks they would encounter but as janet did state there was not significant funding that was provided to go hand in hand with the resolution however after the fact there was some funding that was provided and austin public health was able to do a solicitation and i am going to turn it over to lota fuente director for austin public health and at least have her to walk through that funding that solicitation that was released and just kind of tell you about the agencies that are funded including austin harm reduction lotta   102011 am    you  chair you are muted pichette pa chet  chair can you try try again and we will see if we can hear you so i i am sorry we are still not able to hear you you may need to exit and reenter but  but perhaps we should follow up on the funding piece  i can he is sent me some information  chair okay great  i know she was having problems kind of sending this to me today basically a solicitation was released in december of 2020 and four organizations were awarded funding texas harm reduction was awarded   102115 am  684000 for substance and misuse recovery and peer led harm reduction that did include the onetime funding for mobile unit that they have shown integral care was funded for comprehensive substance misuse service continuum community care substance misuse counseling navigation and wraparound services and then communities for recovery for peer supported recovery program and services which includes wellness as well so those are the agencies that are currently providing services with a contract with austin public health  chair thank you thats very helpful so colleagues what i would like to do now is maybe have a few minutes councilmember fuentes if you could lay out the resolution we are considering next week and then open it up for questions but i think that we now have a context a little bit more context of what work has been initiated what work remains and what our partners have    102218 am  identified as next steps  fuentes thank you thank you chair tovo i heard today as you know we have a an overdose crisis going on in this city and in this county our counterparts at travis county have also declared overdose crisis a public health crisis and so what my item does which everyone should have a copy which i just want to say thank you to everyone on the committee who has cash is in support of this policy item as everyone on the public health committee is a cosponsor of item number 53 and that will be on our agenda for next week for council consideration so what this item seeks to do is to also declare a public health cry i see it looks at creating immediate and longterm strategies to increase awareness of the overdose crisis in our community as well as increase support service that are needed so it does this in a number of ways including equipping all of our first responders with naloxone and increasing training   102319 am  and naloxone to other city departments including but not limited to aph apl and our parks and rec department it increases access to medication assisted treatment as well as looks at expanding interlocal agreements that we have currently with partnerships with the community as was previously listed from acm hayden howard but looking at increases partnerships and services so that we are able to expand treatment and options for our community it also looks at expanding partnerships tweet between our community health paramedic program that does an incredible job right now with assisting and then also tasks our newly created public health commission which is another item that this public health committee has taken action on in creating that commission it tasks them with the objective of creating a comprehensive local plan and action that   102419 am  prioritizes strategies related to prevention treatment and support services for substance use disorders a in addition as we heard both from texas harm reduction alliance and staff there is a need for us to coalesce this data and it is important for us to have a centralized source of data so this resolution also directs the creation of a data dashboard to be shared with staff departments and community organizations additionally it looks at the public raising public awareness about the overdose crisis and so it lays out a public education campaign as well as workshops to inform the local plan of action and then lastly the resolution also updates our local legislative agenda our city of austin legislative agenda to en thought as we prep for the ada texas legislative session that we support the legalization access to the ennil testing strips as well as the expansion    102519 am  of good samaritan laws and to be in opposition of think bills that increase arrests or severity of criminal punishment related to individual experiencing an overdose and so it does a number of things and i want to thank my team and everyone here for all of the conversations that have been had we have been working with our organizations as well as with apa  escott community care and  if i didnt mention dr walkes also dr walkes and the texas harm reduction alliance so we had several conversations about this and this resolution coalesces this work into these strategies thank you  chair great thank you mayor i am going to give you the first opportunity to ask questions since you have a short time frame here and then we will open it up for general questions to the texas harm reduction alliance thank you or   mayor adler i dont think i have a question i think in hearing the reporting   102621 am  i think the will is there  i think the initial work was there but there was obviously not funding provided to go the work so i think it would be really helpful as we go into this next budget sewings have specifically called out for us what it would take to be able to do this work so that we actually get the opportunity to prioritize that work but that appears to be where the disconnect happened thank you  chair i appreciate that thank you and i am mindful of the language that you did direct the manager to bring forward to identify those needs and to prepare any necessary funding requests and i dont believe we got any necessary funding requests so i think it is  we also need to look at what piece of the process didnt happen correctly sorry i fouled up my microphone here what piece of the process didnt happen correctly as we didnt get advanced those funding requests though i think councilmember kitchen you were   102722 am  on the council at the time i believe you were on the resolution i was on the resolution that passed probably unanimously or almost unanimously so i dont know that we can get to the bottom of that but i think it is an issue we need to address the  mayor adler i agree and we can certainly look at what happened in the past but by all means we need to make sure it is a part of the  it doesnt make it into the managers budget we need to know separately what it is going to cost to do this so that council has the opportunity to reprioritize if we want to  i think we just missed it i think the funding request i they we all just assumed it was happening and we shouldnt have done that  chair councilmember  tovo councilmember kitchen  kitchen yeah i would say we can never expect to have one resolution to resolve everything this is an evolving crisis and so we certainly made efforts in the past and those were good and maybe    102822 am  we didnt finish everything we thought but regardless of all that this is an evolving crisis and having the work of our folks on the ground reminding us and coming back to us and saying this is whats not working and this is what needs ramping up we would need that regardless of what we had passed in the past so i think its important for us to remember that that this is the opportunity to come back and say whats really really current right now in terms of what these folks are seeing on the ground for us to focus on  tovo i agree i simply want to make sure that because its not  im only identifying it because its not an isolated issue of that process but absolutely i think youve well said what the current need is which council member fuentess resolution really addresses and so i think thats a good segue to asking questions of our texas harm reduction alliance but council member fuentes it looked like you had a question or a comment   102924 am   fuentes yes i wanted to add on an important element of item 53 is that it directs how to spend the opioid settlement dollars and thats something that the council decided to participate with back back in december we passed a resolution with the opioid settlement dollars so were getting our first funding settlement this month and its anticipated to be 1 point  approximately 15 million and it will be spread out throughout a number of years and truly it will be nine 15 years that well receive settlement dollars so while this is the largest amount of funding this resolution seeks to provide some direction on how to best use those dollars the question i had for the harm alliance is how can our service providers do better around harm reduction and overdose prevention what what else can our service providers be doing as we look at building a   103025 am  robust harm reduction system here locally  thank you for that question council member and thank you to the committee for having us again so i think ill talk specifically about housing housing service providers so we have been hearing many things from our participants for example at south bridge shelter one of our participants mentioned that we had dropped off supplies or another organization had dropped off supplies meaning sterile syringes safe for smoking kits that were there and when they went inside with the supplies they were immediately taken away weve also heard of folks who have been threatened by eviction from these shelters and just general things   103127 am   around smoking cigarettes breaking rules punitive culture punitive policies that really make a revolving door from whether its shelters or transitional housing or even permanent housing so ensuring that service providers are well equipped well trained around how to adopt harm reduction culture and values is one piece of it and ensure that these are actually inside the contracts the written contracts that the city is getting into a relationship with service providers around so theres a lot of supportive housing thats going to be coming online in the future its really really critical that that isnt just supportive housing for people that dont use drugs or for people that follow a really stringent set of rules   103227 am  we have to expand what these units of housing look like the kind of services that people get and really understand that there are diverse needs and our service providers have to meet the diverse needs of people thats just on the housing piece i dont know if you have anything to add on  and more broadly weve lost you know service providers during the pandemic we lost austin recovery for example right we dont have a good network along our whole continuum of care when it comes to substance use support and a lot of it is really high barrier stuff right if you dont have insurance or money youre not going to get any treatment and for the low barrier things like our program were new and were already like way beyond capacity the methadone program is low barrier and much more affordable and we have a long waiting list because theres no coverage for it which is why weve been working with central health to try to include it in a   103329 am  covered medication under the map program that would be an excellent step to bring that treatment make it much more accessible so we have a ton of barriers in our community people want help theyre asking for help and they dont get it its infusing harm reduction into all service provision but its also opening up the types of treatment so people have choice people have access like this should be easy for people when theyre ready for help it should be like okay got you were here because our team is ready and were constantly trying to support people and our team runs into those barriers with folks as well so we have an infrastructure problem as well when it comes to supporting people who want to change their relationship to drug use  tovo thank you we dont have our homeless strategy advisor here to   103429 am   address   kitchen ive been speaking with her i can address  tovo let me explain rest of my sentence i was explaining that we dont have the shelter director here to address the policy so i will ask the assistant city manager if but if you have information councilmember kitchen i would invite you to share what your conversation via text has been with diana and if our staff want to add now or later ill invite them to do the same  kitchen yeah let me share and maybe our assistant city manager might want to add to what im saying first off thank you very much for bringing to our attention the concerns that you all are hearing or seeing about the north bridge and south bridge shelters i do understand that diana gray our homeless strategy officer has i think she scheduled a meeting with you all so you will be able to dig into the details with her at that meeting what she has shared with me is that we generally stipulate harm reduction in   103530 am  our contracts and that the policy at north bridge and it shouldnt be that the policy at both north bridge and south bridge should be that people are not evicted for drug use okay thats the policy and that should be in contract she did state that one of the things she wants to talk to you about is that sometimes what could happen is termination for behavior that may be related to drug use sometimes that can be an issue but regardless all the details and concerns that youre raising i know that she has let me know that she wants to go talk in detail with you all about that because there may be a disconnect between what the policy what the contract sand whats actually happening so what yall are experiencing is important for her to understand so i dont know if you want to add anything to that   103631 am   yeah were meeting with her on monday and looking forward to that  kitchen excellent thats great  tovo thank you for that any other questions  kitchen i just wanted to say thank you to you guys this is very helpful i am curious about  and this may be a different conversation and maybe our assistant city manager can answer it im really curious about what were doing at the city for the map treatment i understand that dr escott is involved i thought with offering met treatment or not offering but perhaps its promoting or making it more available  tovo could you tell us what that is im going to follow our   medication assistance  medication assistance treatment which is one piece thats helpful when people   103731 am  are ready for that does anyone know the level of that activity thats occurring at the city no thats a followup item i would like to understand that from dr escott  all i can say is through our contract with public health initially we were instructed  we werent able to use our funds for medication  assistant treatment and through conversations and education that decision was changed so that we were able to pay it because we pay for folks to get into methadone kickly because theres such a long waiting list and my understanding is that the city might be doing some things around other drugs which is one version of medication assisted treatment but methadone is another type of treatment and its regulated differently so it has to be dispensed through an opioid treatment center so we only have a few of those in austin and i was also told that   103831 am  there are separations because of central health on what the city can fund but i think having a 247 medication assisted treatment program a methadone program in particular would be a huge asset to our community and its something that we should talk to central health and yall should talk to central health because it would require a partnership but i guess theres some limitations to medical care that the city can or cant fund and thats why we were told that mat could not be used with our funds initially so i think that we might need to have a conversation about like what that limitation is for the city because it was really unclear for us and we couldnt get city legal to really clarify exactly what was medical care that the city could fund and what was prohibited so that question still remains for us  kitchen okay do you work with dr escott  no not directly  kitchen okay thats a followup item   103934 am  i can check with my colleagues  and we have access to indiscernible the same a day we work with koasly with ems and other providers in about the community so its not an issue with us is just the methadone  kitchen which is an important tool to have very important tool to have thank you very much  tovo yes vicechair  fuentes  i also want to extend my gratitude to the texas harm reduction alliance its my understanding you have test kits for us to look at to see what they look like and include and it might be helpful for the community to get a lens for and no further questions on my end i wanted to thank my public health committee for joining on as cosponsors and thank you for your previous work on opioid overdoses and understanding and working towards improving our system of care regarding substance use disorders so i also appreciate the work that yall have done  tovo thank you   104035 am  what i would suggest if we have the opportunity to do this is  do we have the opportunity to see those test kits on that little screen over there but im going to first recognize my colleague councilmember harpermadison who i believe has a question maybe while were getting set up for that which thank  you for bringing those that will be really interesting ill recognize you councilmember harpermadison for questions  harpermadison thank you chair i appreciate it i had the opportunity to listen in on the way in and really appreciate the conversation and council member fuentes really appreciate you resurfacing the issue im glad were taking this step forward i dont have questions so much as id like to chair both president items for future consideration and then sort of let the body know the committee know at large that i also intend to bring forward some items and its multitiered we had a work session yesterday where we talked about everything from labor   104135 am  shortage as the direct result of stagnant wages to housing shortage to homelessness crisis to you know everything in between and i think one of the things that was repeated yesterday over and over that we were talking about is i dont know that we as a community have truly seen the manifestation of covid like the byproduct how far it truly affected our community at large and i mean all of us universe sally that said i am finding anecdotally a major uptick in substance use disorder being publicly presented or problem at that time likely presented andrew rivera mental health and wellness issues both in adolescents and in their caregivers so those are some items that i really look forward to us as a body being able to take into consideration moving forward but the conversation that you all were having about crime reduction substance use disorder and its   104235 am  connection to homelessness sort of the way my brain works is i like to see how things are connected so we dont miss opportunities with resources so were not same team but fighting over limited resources so id like moving forward that we could all figure out how these things are connected because the criminalization of poverty homelessness now or people on the verge of homeless devastated by the loss of income theyre about to lose their housing interacting with cps theyre in arrears on paying their parole officers and probation officers theyre all connected but i think were concerned but were trying to triage them as opposed to directly connecting them and figuring out how to address it all at the same time i read some data recently about substance use disorder and how 40 million plus americans facing substance use issues on a regular day but after two years of a global pandemic and loss of   104338 am  income around wage shortages and stagnation and all the other implications i think now is the time in watching our critical infrastructure just cram bell i think this might be the federal reserve time for us to really start talking about getting at it from the root instead of trying to repeatedly triage let get to the symptoms the symptoms are poverty the symptoms are mental health the symptoms are substance  use disorder and i think if we start there we dont have to keep having these conversations about shortages scarcity when it comes to addressing the manifestation of the roots so i really look forward to us diving into the roots us our collectively as partners and getting at the roots i look forward to working more together moving forward i appreciated your presentation and look forward to more support of all my colleagues and anything we can do moving forward to really get at whats making people hurt so bad  really really appreciate that we are really excited this   104440 am  is like an immediate response but definitely have been thinking about the public health commission role of that body with the countys help involved with it too as well because of course texas harm reduction deals with a very at risk population but theres many others that need to be part of the conversation that are part of the issues that we didnt mention today agree for sure one other thing council member fuentes we were going to just raise that there are a few data suggestions that we were thinking could be helpful in the resolution around just data around homelessness that maybe we could look at to add and i think it would help for future conversations too around future solutions  yes absolutely lets huddle on that we have until next week before council takes a vote on it  cool  tovo thank you so i think as our last item kate or paulette if you would like to walk us through what were seeing   104541 am  and then if there are no  unless there are any other comments from my colleagues or our staff well wrap for the day  okay thank you yeah so we just wanted to bring a few things to bring to life kind of what harm reduction looks like you can see theres a fentanyl testing strip there do you want to point to things so thats one of the fools that we mentioned on not the most important tool but a tool to help people understand what is in the drugs theyre using and prevent overdose you can see narcan the nasal spray is there and then the same medication but its injected is there in the orange top so we give out those people have different preferences for how they feel comfortable administering narcan   104641 am  we have sterile syringes our smoking kits we have hygiene kits wound care kits and so these are the life saving tools that we give out on a daily basis to keep people alive and create relationships so that they come back and talk to us more and see if we can walk together on their path to recovery however they define recovery so these are vital to starting that conversation right we cant just go out in the community and say heres some narcan and they will be cool thank you so much throw it out right it has to start with what do you need today and sometimes its not narcan sometimes its a shower  sometimes its wound care so thats how we start the conversation and build a relationship so we need these tools to meet people where theyre at whatever theyre facing that day hoping that theyll come back the next day and the next day  tovo thank you so very very much   104741 am  this has been really informative thank you for the work you do and thank you for bringing along these really visible illustrations of the kinds of resources that youre able to offer its my understanding and i would invite our staff to confirm that in austin anyone can go into a pharmacy and purchase narcan and aloxin that theres a citywide prescription  there is a statewide standing order that was passed in 2015 so technically yes but some pharmacies do discriminate and they will put up barriers and say what do you need it for you need a prescription they might not be educated or because of stigma around people who use drugs they dont make it readily available but it also expensive folks can technically purchase it and if you know to advocate for yourself even if they make it difficult you can get there with them but its not as easy to get as it should be   104845 am  thats why we like to give it out and thats why as paula was mentioned it should be available for free and in as many places as  in the places where a lot of folks are coming through and we can connect with them so like the libraries and parks and everything the other thing weve heard is that for some programs  so like narcan helps with a an opioid overdose we know that fentanyl is now in pretty much all of our substances even if you dont identify as an opioid user youre still at risk of an ownershipoverdose so you still need narcan right now thats a conversation you need to have with folks and a lot of programs they do this at the trail and integral care you have to be flagged as having an opiate use disorder but we know people are dying maybe they dont want to say theyre using at all but also maybe theyre using something else theyre not a heroin user and they also need narcan   104946 am  so thats like a small barrier to accessing narcan that we could fix if we had the conversation and dug into the issue a little bit more and thats the evolving nature of the crisis that councilmember kitchen was talking about so the first step i think is really getting narcan out in the community free for everybody but its  thats just one small step and really we should have been doing it years ago we have lots of ideas obviously and we would be happy to talk more about it  tovo thank you all so very much thank you again for being here today thank you to our staff for participating and for helping us build the context of the work that youve been engaged in and thank you council member fuentes for  your leadership and we look forward to the continued conversation and continued work without further adieu we stand adjourned at 1050  thank you all   10001 pm  to start okay good yeah okay everybody it is 505 on june the 7th 2022 we have a quorum of

you can see highway 71 and then old bee caves road next slide please its just kind of an aerial so you can kind of see what it looks like from a helicopter next slide please again just kind of  its an area that was platted as a roadway that was never built so its just kind of a dysfunctional rightofway next slide please so the area totals 33682   10309 pm   square feet the adjoining property owners on all sides is lnc sky mountain holdings llc public notice to property owners within 300 feet was mailed on april 21st 2022 to approximately 113 property owners staff received one objection all affected departments and private utility franchise stakeholders have reviewed the request and recommend approval subject to the two below one of which is retaining an easement and one is grande add any utilities there the owner would have to pay to redo the construction i dont have any reason to think grande has  looking at the pictures i dont think grande has anything thats just kind of a comment that grande tends to say on all of ours if indeed we have  if you run across some of our lines and   10410 pm  you have to move them its at the developers expense next slide please so when asked on the application how do you plan to develop the area to be vacated the applicantdeveloper said the reclaimed area will be used for private multifamily development and its associated improvements there are site development plans submitted and they are now in progress it is not smart housing speaking with the applicant  the person that showed concerns had concerns regarding development as a whole and how it hurts the environment and so in talking with the applicant online he did say theyre doing five to six acres of the overall 22 acres will be dedicated for parkland next slide please   10513 pm  so again i can answer any questions regarding the rightofway process as it moves along and the applicant can answer your questions regarding the abutting properties and proposed development thank you  okay do any commissioners online or in person have any questions  i just have one question i keep seeing commercials about grande is now astound does that change the

process then its fine it doesnt need to be resent to us  thanks  champion okay do any other commissioners have   10613 pm  any questions it does look  the applicant is here it looks like its kind of in the middle of the woods is that accurate  laughing  so the immediate neighbors  are we looking at this picture what are the immediate neighbors is it commercial is it residential you have to push

development update from cap metro is anna lan  there she is take it away   10816 pm   good afternoon board members thank you for the invitation chair champion my name is anna lan a principal planner with capital metro and im also the project manager of the equitable transitoriented development im happy to come today and share with you guys our project next slide please the overview of todays project is i want to share some of the key progress weve been making especially with our community engagement and some of the deliverables that we have completed so far next slide perfect this project started when we  capital metro  won two grants from the federal transit administration for their tod pilot program we won a total of 165 million to study about 21 stations on   10919 pm  the orange and blue right rail station we are working in partnership with our city team warner is here today would you like to introduce yourself real quick  hi yall this is warner cook a senior planner with the housing and planning department and one of the core city staff members working on tod with anna  thanks warner along with our city partners were working very closely with atp on this project so from the beginning of our project we expanded our project scope from a limited set number of stations on the orange and blue to more like a systemwide analysis and coordination with our city team for consistency and for future implementation so on top of the station area plans and corridor plan update we really wanted to expand some of the analysis for the study to 98 stations on the line   11021 pm   so this project really doesnt propose any changes to zoning or direct the orange and blue line design process i just had to make that distinction next slide please im sure everyone here since this is the utc has heard of tod the reason we started thinking about the shift and adding the equity away from tod is we are mind of the impact of traditional tods on neighborhoods where development comes in and the rent goes up affecting the local renters homeowners and small businesses especially and this is very sensitive issue as austin is rapidly growing our neighborhoods are changing and prices are going very high so we want to shift to the equitable portion where its more about reducing or preventing displacement but its really about reversing traditional inequalities and   11122 pm  creating new economic opportunities that was my kid making a surprise appearance its about creating the new economic opportunities for residents along these transit corridors and we want to do that by creating as many new housing opportunities while prioritizing the underserved communities next slide please this is a diagram done by our  one of our artists in cap metro and this diagram really encapsulates our project vision what you see here is something that is distinctly austin its multimodal you see electric buses with light rail with bikes and its a neighborhood we hope is accessible for people of all abilities and age groups there are a mix of housing types for renters and prospective and   11222 pm  current homeowners although it isnt spelled out its implied that apartments are affordable to a range of incomes and the place feels welcoming to both existing and new residents and in this image you see that commercial spaces are being used by small local businesses as well as communities serving uses such as library and community center and also a very public  strong public realm next slide please for etod we have five major deliverables we have conducted case studies of other cities who are undergoing etod projects we just completed our existing conditions analysis for those stations along orange and blue we are in the progress of etod policy framework recommendations   11323 pm  and updating the priority tool so i want to highlight that together task five and six will formulate a plan directed by council last summer and lastly a select few stations will go into the station area vision plans that will also be handed to the city to carry into the regulatory plan stage down the road next slide please this diagram here is our project timeline we officially kicked off last november 2021 with two public meetings that were virtually done due to covid but for this project well go into spring of 2023  and the deliverables are coordinated with the city of austin team as well as the orange and blue line nepa process as well as the fta capital investment grant ratings so currently were in the   11423 pm  second stage of engagement which is really aligned with task five the etod policy framework the first stage concluded in april and we really kind of looked at highlevel feedback regarding priorities and key concerns for the second stage of engagement were really targeting underrepresented groups neighborhoods and small businesses were really hoping to complete the policy framework and the priority tool by august so that the city of austin team can take it into the council adoption process in september and for the station area vision plans were hoping to get them completed by next spring hopefully april next slide please for etod we have six identified goals or visions for this   11525 pm  project and how these six goals came about they are defined collectively from a combination of three sources one is the 30 individual goals identified by council in the tod resolution also goals from nothing about us without us racial equity tool and collective feedback from our first round of community engagement so these goals include a safe and sustainable multimodal transportation for residents to help close racial health and wealth gaps and to preserve and grow affordable housing options in the neighborhoods next slide please the goals also extend to expanding and creating access to highquality jobs in the transit corridor and making sure that community and neighborhood amenities support the needs of the residents   11625 pm  and really want to sustain and grow and support our small businesses along the transit corridors as well next slide please task five the etod policy framework or the toolkit we like to call it is really the meat of this project this task will allow capital metro and the city down the road to best utilize tools according to the needs of each station area based on geography the strategies that we have are divided into five categories of land use urban design real estate mobility housing affordability and business and workforce development each of those categories contain a spectrum of policy tools from easy wins to more of a longterm policy implementation so in combination with the typologies and the prioritization tool the hope is that youll be able to access the most effective strategies   11726 pm   based on stationspecific needs next slide please this is a timeline for reference the key delivery of etod is also really timed really well with key project connect deliveries we really want to make sure that our process does not in any way disrupt the nepa orange and blue line process and to coordinate the delivery such as introducing the station plans until after the finalization of the nepa documents and the federal transit administration record of decision which happens in march were introducing our station plans in april in perfect coordination next slide please this is a slide im really proud to talk about public engagement is something that weve worked very very hard together with the city on this project   11828 pm  so we acknowledge that the traditional engagement methods of the past limit the audience and were missing out on our black latinx and other minority and underrepresented groups such as the elderly access or those facing housing insecurity so as a result we added a variety of new outreach that kind of is meant to bring out the voices from a variety of ways from we work with the cac on a monthly basis and we hold smaller more targeted outreach through focus groups and community connectors and these are all compensated conversations that will help us reach deeper into the community through a peertopeer outreach format is and so far has brought us spectacular feedback next slide please for example our community connectors are recruited through an open recruitment process   11928 pm  we had over 151 applicants apply and 12 were selected from different backgrounds so out of the 12 some are native austinites some have been here for a few years some are retirees some are students and all have some form of community activism background they are paid 25 an hour and the goal is for each of the connectors to reach about 30 to 50 people and they also help us cohost community events we show up to the events that they also sponsor such as for earth day we attended a cleanup event and for juneteenth we have a community bike event that they are hosting that were also sponsoring as well so in the span of three months we have logged over 26 events with over 40 hours of active engagement and 104 folks engaged from the connectors alone   12031 pm  in addition to the community connectors we worked regularly with the cac we have a working group established with the cac so that we can update them every month on key progress so the goal is not to present and inform but were working hard to make sure that every working group session were  working together towards strategies so that they can actually help shape and inform decisions along the way next slide please and the third engagement thats working really well are focuses focus groups anywhere from three to five people led by one to two cohosts and were targeting a variety of groups were targeting grassroots grasstops small businesses and real estate practitioners with special emphasis on affordable housing developers so these conversations are also   12132 pm  compensated we provide a 50 gift card for one hour of discussion so far up to date we have completed 26 focus groups including at least six just in spanish and we have over 120 participants so far so these are conducted in a variety of ways of course we always offer the virtual option but we are also attending community events as part of their meetings such as we were invited to the austin area urban league two weeks ago where they were holding a special session for those facing housing challenges and we were able to engage and have great feedback from participants of that meeting as well so far up to date we have offered over 6000 compensation for just the community group engagement so far next slide please   12235 pm  for those of yall who are interested in keeping track of this project there are a variety of ways to do so i would recommend starting with our project website which is nestled in the project connect website on the project website youll be able to see any updated engagement information survey link youll be able to access our case study summary youll be able to go  meet the community connectors they have a special bio page and we have a special dashboard where you can access some of the key data that we have gathered so far so thats the next slide please this is the last slide that i would like to leave and share with everyone this is immediately accessible with the link above but we have gathered all our data into a publicfacing dashboard where youll be able   12335 pm  to access the existing data along the orange and blue line stations youll be able to see a variety of data such as population or displacement risk jobs urban design and real estate data so an example would be you are able to click on any station and lets say you are able to access crestview youll be able to see information as how many multifamily housing inventory there are in that area what is the vacancy for crestview what is the current and future housing inventory projection what is the current rent and what has been the rent increase from 2011 to 2021 on this website youll also be able to look through the aerials of these individual future station areas and also it has really cool economic data where youll be able to look up total job by industry per station as well as the amount and types of    12438 pm  small businesses by station as well this is the data that we hope is very useful to a variety of folks for community meetings neighborhood associations even agency meetings public agency meetings as well this is something that were continuing to expand this is already a very great tool but in about a month or two well be able to expand the resource to systemwide analysis so this includes  concludes the presentation warner and i are happy to take any questions you have thank you  champion all right thank you very much for the presentation commissioner brooks has a question  brooks okay your goal  youre providing a lot of data which is useful in making decisions   12539 pm  but your decisions are really about one or two etod projects is that correct thats going to be the outcome  were actually looking at corridor level not just stationspecific but corridorlevel analysis some of the station areas will have deeper analysis there are several that were considering we are considering for example north lamar transit center and crestview so for those neighborhoods that face greater development opportunities in upcoming years those would have a little bit more but all the stations identified in the 21area project boundary will have levels of analysis and recommendations  brooks okay well my concern  i have played some with the website thank you for the link   12639 pm  and im somewhat concerned about the naturally occurring affordable housing by the description on the website these buildings are typically older gardenstyle apartments and the problem with taking older gardenstyle apartments and somehow making them official affordable housing is you lock them in amber and most of these are twostory buildings in bad physical condition and preserving them is a doubtful issue i went and looked at the foundation communities it has something like 18 projects going none of them involve a twostory building except for a couple of hotels theyve gotten theyre all building three and four and bigger and taller buildings why because that provides more units of affordable housing so one naturally occurring affordable housing unit   12740 pm   twostory unit that holds 100 units right now could be if it were reconstructed three or 400 so i worry about the thought about preserving those but that led me to another piece of information that you might want to include is code complaints are publicly accessible in the city of austin the code department has a website i would like to see the code complaint data also merged into the website and see whether these are in fact predominant buildings that are predominantly in bad shape or just in general which of the affordable housing is not as affordable housing as it looks from a maintenance  thank you thats a very good recommendation thank you  champion if i can jump in for a second because the first thing i wrote down  i know these etod goal images are just aspirational sort of discussion   12841 pm  points but what is missing from them is vertical mixed use completely and it worries me that  i hadnt looked in detail at the things that are occurring in affordable housing but when i look at it as racially none of these  aspirationally the land use transitsupported land use none of these aspirational pictures is really picturing transitsupported land use i know these are just image us but it does worry me a bit that people arent thinking deeply enough and maybe you know loftily enough if thats a word about what it really does take to get to transitsupported land use theres vmu discussion happening right now in city council its not there yet but i would like to think that if there are pieces of the city additionally trying to drive that direction it will provide some political support and political background   12941 pm  for those kinds of decisions overall i dont want to say  i love this presentation and i love the amount of data thats there i didnt get deep enough but theres a lot of data there i have one more question who do you see using that data on this website and how do they provide some feedback on it what is the goal how does a person actually look at this website see these kinds of insights what is the mechanism for bringing that to you all  for feedback  champion yes  i think the standard feedback for any kind of etod project is we have a dedicated email listed on the website etodcapmetrocom if they have questions or feedback in regards to the   13042 pm  dashboard that would be the best way to reach us how people can use this dashboard  it really varies we compiled the data that you would have taken five or six different dashboards to compile all together and this is because traditionally our tod projects we do existing conditions but it sits in a pdf it doesnt age very well on the shelf and very few people get to use it or very much see it so we  brought that all digitally as a way to be more transparent with our data the hope is for us well be able to pull up all the relevant data for that area so theyll be able to see some of the key issues right away this is something that im hoping that at least cap metro will be utilizing more hopefully it will be useful for   13142 pm  the city of austin team as well  champion thank you for that i stepped on my first question so let me go back to that one is there outright plans or vision for vertical mixed use and for levels of density that are transitsupportive around the stations how far along is that discussion  thats a perfect question that is a stage of the project that we will start this fall when we get into the stationarea vision plans thats where were looking at solutions for specific station development and thats where the density question will come out full force and our consultant teams will be looking at a variety of different development options but right now were still in the policy section so were looking at all the possible policies that might support that physical development down the road  champion okay thank you  and ill just add to that thats exactly correct anna   13243 pm  we are looking at strategies for all kinds of different things some stations may be more ready for more density other ones may need other strategies so were taking this approach  were working with the cac internally with city staff and cap metro staff consultants right now on that but the goal is that in augustseptember like anna said we would have a toolkit of strategies and would be diving into applying those strategies at specific stations later on in the fall  champion okay thank you i love the idea that youre paying people because it is difficult to get people involved and i think it is a perfect use of money to say hey do you have some ideas opinions and time its literally worth something to us so double cheers for that who else has  any other commissioners with questions   13344 pm  yes  i dont want to throw a curve but anna whats been the most surprising observation that youve made during this process something that you just didnt know until you were into the middle of it  i can definitely say one of the key feedback that weve received is how difficult a barrier of entry is to access any kind of public services so when we go out into the communities we ask people about things they want to see in the neighborhood and the feedback from residents and businesses is i dont know how to access resources or it is way too difficult for me to get through the affordable housing application process i dont even know where to look i dont know how to apply for it the applications are like 80 pages long and for small businesses they dont know how to access all the    13446 pm  possible funds to go through so that was our surprise it was not necessarily the lack of some of the existing support but just folks dont know how to access it or its too difficult to access we also had a lot more feedback about the need as commissioner brooks mentioned the need for the missing middle housing so maybe in the beginning of the study we were thinking affordable housing is our targeted goal and thinking about levels of affordability within that but we have a lot of community feedback about workforce housing development the missing preservation of the missing middle housing that has become embedded into our strategies as well that we didnt originally anticipate as much as we did  thank you thats really helpful to know about   13546 pm   champion commissioner somers were you about to     somers i had a question i know that obviously these lines and project connect travel throughout the city through some areas that may have more traditionally privileged individuals through some areas that have more lowerincome individuals marginalized communities one of my questions is how are you thinking about  im kind of thinking about a place like crestview i used to live pretty close to there back in the day and sometimes in some of our planning processes we ask people who live near there who may not want something to change but when we look at the whole picture of all of project connect crestview with its convergence of different transit and being in a highopportunity area with particular schools things like that might be a really good place to build super densely but maybe the people there dont like to have new   13647 pm  things go in by them im kind of choosing this example as one i know really well how are you addressing that in what we might say higher income higheropportunity areas where maybe people dont accept a lot  theres more  anymore nimbyism you could say this is a concern we have when we consult the community sometimes the community says no and we have to put things somewhere how are you seeing the tool address these tradeoffs  im thinking warner may be perspective to answer this because she had a really great answer before warner i dont know if you want to take a stab first  yeah so the focus station that anna mentioned in the presentation that were looking into in some cases are to poke staff to take a first stab at all these different areas around   13748 pm   town trying to purposely pick stations that had a lot of different characteristics were looking at the east riverside corridor which has an existing regulating plan and a lot of the naturallyoccurring affordable housing that commissioner brooks is mentioning and it will probably need very different strategies and well hear different things from those people that live there today than the areas of crestview were looking at hyde park around 38th street north lamar transit center another one thats very different and also cap metro so we purposely picked these different stations to try to start getting a sense of how different stations fit into the whole picture of the entire system because were not just thinking about creating only the complete communities but some areas will be designations some will have more jobs than housing but one of the things i would say specifically to the idea of density and affordable housing in highopportunity areas is that is something that housing   13850 pm  and planning is very much focused on the report just came out from housingworks that showed our current inventory is very much concentrated in districts 14 with not as much as in other districts of the city so while were trying to get affordable housing along the project connect lines were also separate from project connect entirely just trying to get more housing in highopportunity areas so were not continuing to concentrate poverty in certain parts of the city as well  somers thank you  champion okay oh yes commissioner brooks  brooks because nobody else did it and its my obligation to do it buses i realize that youre well overwhelmed just considering some of the orange and blue line stations but the gold line  the moment the bus  the trains start running on the orange and blue lines the gold line   13953 pm  will  construction will start in theory on another rail line and the line between light rail stations and metrorapid stations and ordinary bus stations is a fine one and its one to keep in mind  thank you  champion okay are there any other questions comments chris  i have no questions ms zenobia joseph is with us so were going  if no one has any other questions chair well move to   champion yes that would be perfect  thank you mr chair members im zenobia joseph i just wanted to make a few comments as it relates to north lamar transit center which is a focus area on page 3 of the   14056 pm  document specifically im really baffled as to when north lamar transit center became part of the equitable transitoriented development and also part of project connect the presentations that were given to the community in 2019 and 2020 both referenced the december 17th 2018 longrange plan  which excluded north lamar transit center and started south of us 183 so this entire project appears to be disingenuous i will call to your attention i did send a memo and it actually includes the april 15th 2021 presentation in part by sharmilla from capital metro where she briefed the mobility committee and she said that the downtown stations are excluded for a very   14158 pm  specific reason but she lacked transparency and didnt say what that specific reason was so i would ask the staff thats briefing tonight to mention why we have plaza for example transitoriented development its on thursdays agenda again for council to consider not putting affordable housing there a fee in lieu of affordable housing so while i certainly appreciate the comments that were made as it relates to not concentrating poverty i would call to your attention that 80 area median income is 55000 thats the standard on the rail line specifically the gold line was mentioned by commissioner brooks the streets are named for african americans there however its 80 area median income for the only affordable highland village apartment there near the housing authority of the city of austin because they said on   14258 pm  december 17th 2020 the interest in the area they didnt want to serve lowerincome individuals imagine that at austin community college which is subsidized by public funds at hyde park on the orange line council actually spent 37 million at baker school affordable housing housing there and council usurped that process and on the blue line as you may recall october 17th 2019 council rezoned 1308 units and the uprooted authors heather and her coauthors wrote an article a week later and said council didnt listen to them because that was one of the largest displacements in austins history  buzzer sounding   i think its disingenuous to keep talking about    14359 pm   ms zenobia your time has expired but please do finish your thought  yes i would ask the commissioners to look at the memorandum that i sent and if you should make a recommendation to council to please ask them to restore northeast connectivity north of us 183 if you have any questions ill gladly answer them at this time  i want to acknowledge she did send me a memorandum a few minutes ago i will get that out to the commissioners now so  champion okay thank you for your comments mrs joseph i would like to follow up i think really with city staff in particular the question about the north lamar transit center i think you know ms josefs question is essentially is that truly part of the etod area you can jump in ms joseph if you want to restate just that particular part because i think thats a straight factual    14500 pm  question and we might be able to get an answer  okay thank you mr chair so the factual question is december 17th 2018 is when capital metro actually approved the longrange vision plan and if you look at the maps it actually cut off the words north lamar for north lamar transit center and commissioner brooks can probably speak to this better than i because he testified and mentioned to them that if they left out north lamar there might not be ridership because the federal transit administration to actually fund the light rail system so the factual question that i have is at what point was there coordination between texas department of transportation txdot the city of austin and capital metro because the slide that we saw from the communitys perspective all said that coordination was required because the city of austin doesnt own the rightofway for route 275 which is north lamar boulevard   14603 pm  so im just wondering when that coordination occurred and how did that north lamar transit center get included in the literature when the map that was adopted in 2018 excluded it  brooks perhaps youre confusing the north lamar transit center itself with rail service north of north lamar transit center but im now looking at the august 2021 map cap metro map and it shows north lamar transit center in very large letters and in addition public meetings have been held about the design of a light rail station at north lamar transit center now what upsets me is that its the end of the line but north lamar transit center is definitely included in project connect  yes respectfully commissioner im just asking at what point was the coordination done   14704 pm  there is a march 2020 presentation on page 29 that said  30  north and i am pretty involveds a you are and i have not seen where texas has coordinated and so im referring to the comments that you made where you said the highest concentration of people below the poverty line in all of austin you said was rundberg and lamar and you said youll actually have  i dont think if you leave that segment out youll actually have enough riders to fund the rest of the system and so im just wondering how the terminus moved  brooks campo came out with their forecast and there will be more than enough ridership than the rest of the system there is no question that that area would be  if i were   14806 pm   running the world that area would be  there would be a station at rundberg and lamar end of the story but the actual story is it has not been dropped from the project map plan it is still considered to be the second phase part of some future phase of that plan whether we can believe them or not i dont know but thats the current status  if i may commissioners if the conversation were to continue between mr ruven and ms zenobia i would encourage that potentially off the commission i dont know if we call it the dais or not but it might be best for that conversation to take place outside of the commission unless staff specifically have any questions that they can answer or if any other commissioners have any other questions  champion i think thats okay let me just ask one question does staff have a specific answer or is it happened and   14908 pm  its part of the plan you can get back to us with some details  i would need to check with austin transportation department on when it specifically occurred but i know that txdot has been reviewing the draft design deliverables from the consultant alongside city staff ive seen their comments in there as weve been going through i can confirm that coordination is going on i cant confirm when it started  champion okay so that is a good answer if you can find it or any record you can forward it to chris who can forward it to ms joseph that would be great okay  mr chairman may i just make this one last comment north lamar transit center opened in 1985 and it has taken them over 30 years just to put a sidewalk from affordable housing to north lamar transit center so i would just ask you to keep that context in mind when were talking about that area thank you   15009 pm   champion okay thank you for your time and your contribution as always all right are there any other discussion points on this agenda item is there any request from staff from us this is just listed as an update do you need anything from us besides our comments and feedback  no i think if individual commissioners have comments or feedback that would be great otherwise we will keep you updated as we move into the next phase for station area vision plans and maybe seeing us back later on in the fall if we start the council adoption process for the policy plan i would assume that yall would be on the road show so  champion okay sounds good thank you all for your time all right moving on to item 2c metrobike update from jason   15111 pm  jonmichael  were going to have david orr present on i believe atds side and then i believe kirk will be presenting on  yeah or chad ballentine will take over the presentation david ill hand it over to you  hi hi name is david orr i work in the mobility office of the transportation department ill be  presenting todays metrobike update on behalf of assistant director jason along with chad the demand response and innovative mobility vp at cap metro next slide please were going to go quickly over how it started and how its going and where do we go from here next slide please so in summer of 2013 the citys first public bike share   15212 pm  started the austin b cycle system and it started with a contract with bcycle and bike share of austin for five years two separate companies summer of 2018 each contract was updated to 2023 in the summer of 2020 we signed an interlocal agreement with cap metro to partner on the expansion and maintenance of the system in the fall of 2021 there was a strategic expanse plan which mapped out proposed expansion to the system in summer of 2022 we are proposing to do an updated interlocal agreement amendment with cap metro and this would be a tenyear agreement next slide please   15315 pm  so in 2013 it started off with 11 stations in 2014 were up to 43 stations and 350 bikes all the way until now we have almost 80 stations and 850 bikes 350 are ebikes electric next slide please last year we had a quarter of a million trips in the metrobike system next slide and just note that the ebikes even though they represent less than half of the total bikes we have in the system represent most of the rides that occur in the system they are preferred like at a   15418 pm  41 ratio over the old manual pedal bikes another innovation is we now are introducing these modular docks which each independently check in and check out bikes and they install as easily and take up equipment with the standard bike rack so its really quick they fit among the trees very nicely we dont have to have this 40foot footprint for each station its given us a lot of flexibility next slide please whats not fun about a cat riding a bicycle we have an artist a very talented local artist and we have been placing that art on the bikes and on the stations and its getting all over town   15519 pm  now and we just wanted to make sure you knew that were doing some fun things with it too and now im going to turn it over to chad ballentine to talk about where we go from here next slide  chad  this is christopher parks utc liaison can you hear us okay  yes i can hear you now thank you  there we go all right the presentation is yours  wonderful so again im chad ballentine vice president of demand response and innovative mobility at capital metro very excited   15620 pm  to talk to you about this as well its been a great partnership with the city of austin and its really going to be an awesome partnership moving forward we have big plans weve already worked with our board of directors to get approval to enter into an agreement with the city of austin to expand and improve the bike share system well be going to the city of austin council meeting in july to do this what were looking to do is were looking to make this the best bike share program in the country but more specifically were looking to transition our fleet to an alleassist electric fleet those are incredibly popular if you havent used them i encourage everyone to try them theyre awesome they extend the reach of the service and the program well be doing a lot of coordination with transit for first mile and last mile   15722 pm  integration as well as as we roll out project connect with all of the different light rail lines as well as the metrorapid lines really making this a hand in hand expansion so that it naturally coordinates well with transit well focus on promoting metrobike to new users certainly we want to keep our existing users but we want to make sure we have an equity component to where we get folks who arent generally on bikes nowadays we want to expand the reach of the metrobike program to nontraditional communities including folks maybe even people with disabilities that would be another awesome thing to see if we could do that so thats our plan as we move forward david showed you that modular dock the 30 dock the single dock that is something we want to start doing a little bit more of really putting these stations into smaller places where we can really put in a   15824 pm  very specific answer to a transportation challenge that weve had in the past where one of those huge docks with eight ten fifteen docks just doesnt make sense to put into a neighborhood so this gives us a lot of flexibility and we want to integrate with all ages and all abilities the bicycle network the city has been working on im blown away by what has already been done weve already hit over 200 miles of this bicycle network were moving to 400 miles of this network so making sure the bike share program is expanded along with that is going to be a key element we want to make sure we have continuous improvement cap metro is great at maintenance and ongoing operations so we want to bring that to  the metrobike program by continuing to keep the staff we have but give them the resources they need to up the game to make sure we have more up time better maintenance and   15924 pm  better availability across the board and next slide so were going to be doing  moving forward with an interlocal agreement with the city of austin because our first round of the interlocal agreement was great but we know we can do better we know we can do more we want to transition the bike share of austin staff the monoprofit  nonprofit running the program to our cap metro staff pay living wages benefits really make sure that this is a sustainable program for the long term we want to make sure that operational sustainability is going to be a big key as well with this and we know that we need to make this a sustainable business model but we want to make sure that theres equity thats going to be a big component of it we wont always just be chasing fares we want to add elements like an affordable program continue the   20024 pm  program they have with the 5 annual membership potentially expand that with other new so what this will look like is a ten year expansion were looking around the general ballpark of 11 million of an expansion for the program which would be pretty transformational for the whole program this will really focus on the capital equipment you know the new bikes the ebikes better stations more reliability more reliable interaction in general and so thats the general direction were going with this interlocal agreement next slide and yeah so that is pretty much it were very excited about this well take questions we do plan to do a large expansion that will be working through the expansion plans coming the next six to nine   20125 pm  months coming back to everyone and its going to be an incredibly participatory process the transit system going the bike network also talk about where the people want to be using the system and all kinds of things its a very exciting transition so if its all right with the committee we can certainly open it up for questions  all right thank you im going to jump in with a couple of questions because i find this very exciting and i love the idea of the 100 bike in particular the 3 modular docks i love the idea of a pair of bikes deep in the neighborhood that people are near transit but not near enough to walk i have a strategic question for yall if youve thought about this and if you have where you land on are these 30 modular docks is it to try and get new into the system totally    20226 pm  into the biking system is there a strategy for getting people who are transit you know users likely transit users because the area is fairly rich maybe a little bit outside the walk shed not really a scooter territory you know to like dig deeper into transit users and the more of transit users or how  what is your strategic thinking on that  i can start and david you can certainly jump in theres a  you know what we found with these ebikes is people go a lot farther those heavy manual powered bikes you dont go as far and now that we have these ebikes you can go so much further so this really allows us to get that extra reach that we normally wouldnt get with the manual bikes this is an additional tool to kind of add extra elements where it doesnt make sense to build the whole station its kind of you know were using the right tool for the job whereas you know we used a hammer for   20326 pm  everything with a larger station now we can really get  find information about specific smaller areas and it also allows us to instead of putting it all in one chunk it allows us a corner here a street corner over there maybe down the block the more concentrated you have some of these areas and the more you can see the docks the more its on their mind the more they feel like its a more reliable opportunity it allows us to kind of get into those smaller spaces and we think theres a lot of other potential uses for it as we continue down the path of looking at where all we can stick these because you just dont needs a much real estate as well that is another really nice thing when youve got the small awkward spaces that just dont really quite fit at whole stations there are really good solutions for that as well   yeah so smaller stations closer together deeper in the neighborhoods kind of the goal you know and just the flexibility of them the old stations are   20428 pm  solar powered and the current ones have  have little batteries in them so were not constantly looking to see if we have enough sunlight exposure to keep the station   okay just want to ask the question maybe a slightly different way so if you have a strategy for which of the kinds of potential users to place these i mean i agree with all the things you said is this going  going to pick a random place out at springdale pretty far from the city still areas of density or is it you know denser neighborhoods where you think there might be a lot of users who dont normally use this kind of system just interested in where youre going to distribute these resources  yeah well one of the key pieces of this is it doesnt have a kiosk so its not a screen you know you would have to use a smartphone to access these or a fob and so we have to be very cautious about putting them anywhere and   20530 pm   everywhere for folks that dont have a smartphone or arent comfortable using a smartphone arent used to using a smartphone generally that is you know like the university of texas or like the student population theyre really savvy so that is an easy fit for those kinds of areas but you know i think were still learning how to use them and where they fit best because these are brandnew were still just testing to make sure that the technology works well so a lot of use cases that we could do with these and so were still kind of working through that  okay its a totally valid answer one more question and then ill open it up to the rest i was glad to hear you say maybe youre not going to do so much fair chasing because one of the things i was planning to bring it to next months utc meeting have you considered a basically unlimited debit card unlimited fob card for the ebikes because the worst that can happen a lot of people use bikes if youre not really faces the fares   20635 pm  is that under consideration  i think everything is under consideration i know that is a terrible abc chuckles everything is under consideration when we delink getting fares to the rest of the program then we can really reframe how were thinking about everything and how people use it our main goal is to get more people on bikes and using bikes and make them more reliable make them more of an everyday option for people our goal is going to be more driven by trying to get people on bikes and also making it easy to use because with transit we would love to make this something very seamless if you have your transit you know fare you can maybe have a smart card rolling out a amp program with our transit system we would love to integrate that maybe we have employers who pay for the employees to use the bus and bike so youre not adding up when you get on and off the bike you get on the bus get off the bike you dont think about it quick seamless   20735 pm  transition were trying to get away from chasing the funds and focusing on what the user experience is going to be i think that is the best way to get people using these it is easy and you dont want to have to think about it the more we do that i think the better were going to have a chance to get more rider for sure  all right thank you for detail okay  my question was going to be what is the current integration for the fare and the whole payment system with cap metro and how has that morphed over the last two or three years and you mentioned you are planning some additional improvements in that a little more detail in that area  thats a great question so you know two years ago it was really you had to have the  indiscernible and then cap metro fares and they were very different weve done the first step of an integration where   20836 pm   you can on the cap metro app buy one pass that is for transit and bike all in one transaction really cool but the only problem is its a deep integration and once you activate your bike you still have to download the bike share app to unlock it so its not a good user experience right now that was sort of our you know step one our tip toeing into these integrated fares and so thats where we are right now weve got  you can buy the pass but you still kind of have to make sure you have that app and then it will unlock the bike so we want to get to the point where we can integrate the app so you only have to have one app or one account so that its a lot easier but that is part of what were doing with this interlocal agreement this opens the door for us to commit some heavy dollars investing into making that a little bit more seamless because right now its a little clunky i will admit    20937 pm   cap metro these challenges different types of cars different types of apps different types of bar codes and scan codes but theyre very serious about supporting the move to you know a single app and single way to use those systems  i have a question about how far out you intend to place stations because if i rented a bike from downtown like in the first hour of the free bicycling i can get out to the k2 stadium or i could get all the way to the target on south mopac and do some errands but if i have no place to check it in im incurring fees for the whole time the bike is there that is a little cost prohibitive also you can go so much farther on an ebike is that part of your plan like to put the stations far out like south of 71  so right now well  we will be talking more about our strategic   21038 pm  expansion in the coming months in this coming year and that is going to be part of the discussion what were trying to do is balance  we want to make sure that we have enough density so you have a place to check your bike in and check your bike out because thats key if youre traveling really far you have nowhere to check it in its not going to be very effective and so we are going to slowly build this out its best not to do islands were going to try to build this out in a contiguous manner but by partnering with transit by putting this at all the rapid stops the rail stops and all of those kind of things that will at least allow folks to get to q2 stadium if you want to take your bike over to plaza saltillo and take the train to q2 stadium that is an option too so it is possible we dont have any definite boundaries right now as to where it will or will not go that is going to largely be driven by community engagement fees so were looking forward to that and as well as funding   21138 pm   too i would have no problem having it all over the city if i possibly could far north far south as far as we can take it so thats going to really rely on funding also community engagement for that process  thank you  are there additional questions any other commissioners okay all right well thank you for the update i dont think theres any other followup thank you for your time  great thank yall  all right moving on to the next item item d the north congress avenue plaza i guess state preservation board ready when you are  good evening commissioners my name is   21239 pm  chris kearns im with the state preservation board good morning  or good evening im here this evening to give a small presentation on the pedestrian improvements the state hopes it can work with the city to make at the north congress avenue intersection with martin luther king junior boulevard the former north congress avenue at this point its now being converted into a large pedestrian mall if you could advance the slide please and here is a rendering that would show you  right now its just a whole lot of dirt being moved all over the place but a few trees that are going in the  to what would be the left side of that grand outlay there and probably by the fall will be inviting austin   21339 pm  to come down and start using this new civic amenity next slide please as part of some longterm planning that we initiated in 2016 which was also the time that the city passed a mobility bond in 2016 and university embarked on their speedway mall we feel like all three entities have finally reached a point where the plans that were aspirationsal six years ago have come to fruition and we need to make some changes and this kind of goes through the history of how we arrived at where we are today the sequencing was to build the first section of the mall continue the slide please which is shown in the orange there and then here is an nice symmetric view which shows the mashing of the two buildings which are   21441 pm  somewhat more elaborate with skin but the masking is pretty much adequate to what were talking about to the far right would be where the george hw bush building fronts the former congress avenue right of way and to its right would be martin luther king and you can see on just the other side leaving the frame blanton museum more to the center of the picture is the barbara jordan building which they will start occupying in late this month and early july continue the slide please and the second phase is now under way were actually doing some of the exploratory work on the sites which are presently two parking lots at 15th street the work there should  the construction work currently theres    21542 pm  architectural planning being done but the construction work probably start in early 2023 and will take about two and a half to three years to complete thats shown by the lighter orange in the previous section or the previous phase of the work is shown in the red continue and this just shows that you know here we are were bringing 3000 more state employees down to the center of downtown to the capitol complex its an area that is bounded by tenth street to the south mlk to the north lavaca to the west and trinity to the east of which you know weve grown  we will be growing from about 9000 to about 12 to 13000 state employees next slide please which interesting would be like fort worth   21643 pm  absorbing lubbock in terms of you know if you want to get a sense of scale so were getting ready to have a huge impact on the northern tier of downtown this is a detail from our master plan where we discussed with our urban planners and with the city how we would treat some of the roads that we do need to cross the mall space provide some circulation within our capital complex and to you know for the betterment of just general transportation grid through northern tier of downtown you can see theres a speed table and a different  and a differentiated surface for the street you know depicted in the pinkishred color and where the streets 16th 17th and 18th street cross the mall   21744 pm  continue so internal so our space we will be making those improvements and those will be part of what happens in the next three to four months as we complete the mall what we also studied was what needed to occur on the streets on our perimeter the major arterials and the  here is martin luther king boulevard you can see the cross section is  well let me  the cross section here is the same as what the city has also come up with in the 2016 mobility bond if you go to the next slide i believe that is where it will show the similarity between the two yes sir you have it this is out of the 26 bond proposal cross section for what mlk would look like   21846 pm  we  by way of this kind of shows all entities are in agreement as to what the profile of the street cross section needs to be if youll go to the next slide and in also shows at fifteenth street the cross section for 15th the idea is for the capital you scwaish which interestingly austin texas is maybe one of a  dozen cities out of hundreds of cities in the world specifically created as the seat of government and part of the original historic grid for the planning of the city by waller was capital square what were doing for the first time in 180plus years so were adding capital mall to that and this   21947 pm  will be a major linkage well come to talk to yall in several years when we finish phase ii lets continue forward here so one of the things as ive said we address in our plans actively theyre actively being built the cross streets as you see 18th and 17th and 16th what is at the very bottom of that rendering is a  albeit kind of rather generic but the idea is to suggest that there needs to be some type of differentiation to the urban street scape there as the capital mall crosses over to the blanton and whats interesting weve all started this plan six years ago were all in agreement unfortunately we are still looking at 1970s urban arterial there next slide please   22049 pm  and here is just a small rendering out of  or just a small take out of our master plan that shows how this street might relate to our site and of course somewhat anonymously on the north side the blanton who we would want to engage with the university of texas along with the city in how to create a pedestrianfriendly crosswalk or crossing space not just a crosswalk between the two entities next slide please this is directly out of the 2016 mobility bond allowed i believe 19 million for plans to improve mlk all the way from 130 to ih35 and then this section which   22150 pm  was ih35 to lamar boulevard for the 19 million they basically did an overlay of an existing condition and said thats as far as we have dollars to take this project if you will notice just to the left there you can see the intersection were talking about it has very basic outlines of what might be some medians a crosswalk improvements but really none of the embellishments that would really set this  really convey to the pedestrian that this is pedestrianfriendly zone next slide please one of the things about the capital mall is its intended to be actively occupied this is a small outdoor   22251 pm   amphitheatre that weve constructed this rendering kind of shows that you would have about a 300 to 500person audience capacity we expect that this will get weekly use of course it will be obvious maybe the cold of winter and the heat of summer might be some hiatuses but in the nicer weather months you know there would be you know weekly activity were expecting at least 400000 people a year using the mall and that is over and above what would be the state employee load using the mall which would add several hundred thousand more visits daily as they come to and from work next slide please and here is another green space that will occur in our second phase that we create an internal park   22352 pm  amongst several historic structures that still exist the church the covert house and some older apartment buildings that were kept from the wrecking ball mid last century again the idea was to convey just how much of an active space we intend for the capital mall to become as gentlemen gem stone for austinites and texans from across the state next slide please and you know what i also want to bring up is you know university of texas they built their speedway mall this is just a rendering then if you go to the next slide it shows its complete and its in use there is now a pedestrianfriendly way to get from dean keeton down to eleventh street   22453 pm  and then we have unfortunately mlk and 15th street are just where absolutely comes to a crashing halt we go right back to 1970s urban architecture transferred architecture and then we resume again with a nice pedestrian green space again that seems to be over and over again city planners urban planners talk about you know you activate a city by creating these walkable spaces we have  we have both collectively between the university and the state probably spend a billion dollars putting together a very inviting pedestrian landscape what is missing is when we get to the city streets its back in the previous century and weve implored through   22553 pm  the downtown commission we really want to have all the parties come to the table we are in agreement about the symmetries or the cross sections for the streets and its time to act further as  not only is it time to act but finally the space will be finished the university as we go to the next slide they will be in the next year completing their new courtyard between the two blanton buildings which well have these very eye catching structures as ive said the capital mall will be definitely getting its feet underneath them the ability to share across these spaces in a safe manner and also one that is aesthetically pleasing to the pedestrian where they dont feel likes a game of frogger you know to    22654 pm  get across one of these heavilytrafficked urban arterials can happen and what is more when im saying its finished zonewise all the blocks that weve turn up for three year all of blocks that ut has torn up for three years because theyve had to work on the realignment of red river the other work doing on the southeastern part of the campus is over with and now we can put some new street improvements in that will actually stay there  went be torn out in two more years because of the new albeit i35 will be under construction and orange line under construction but you know this one pocket you know six blocks either way or six blocks one way and three blocks the other will be kind of a completed zone in this type much   22755 pm  instage improvement would know have a lasting effect next slide please and just another rendering if you were standing at the capitol mall looking across that would just be the view so you can see how they you know these planners who built these beautiful civic amenities you know are just inviting you to use them but you know theres this  you know this ribbon of concreature that you know  concrete that is carrying 35 miles per hour traffic and you are bent for leather on making it to the freeway or making it to guadalupe that we could calm the traffic down and allow those hundreds of thousands of visitors that we expect to have more of a pedestrianfriendly experience is what were looking to do and next slide   22856 pm  and again i want to thank the commission for having us here this evening and well look forward to any questions that we can answer and any input you know that we can offer up  champion well thank you for that waiting for people to get on the screen okay do the commissioners have questions or comments  i seem to be the first commenter i serve as the liaison to the downtown commission and thats where i first heard the presentation and weve had so many changes in our staffing and so many active projects underway and i just wanted to make sure that this got the attention that it needed not just contributing to the construction of whatever might be but in the design and the   22956 pm   updating i mean from all sides  like he just said the speed the accessibility to pedestrians and bikes and all of the things that this committee  or commission talks about all the time this is a real good place to focus all of those good things and thats why i was excited about bringing it here  well thank you it is exciting and the visualization is nice and you definitely say the right things so my question would be how is it going with the city is the city indifferent or not engaged enough or engaged or not   unfortunately the city is extremely busy and as i said as the previous meeting they have this increase to complete and so its hard to get everybody to focus but i think that by reaching out to a forum such as the urban transportation   23056 pm  committee  commission is an opportunity to say can we all bring it to the table focus on what  what the city would need to trigger this internally to get started and then obviously the university and the  the state being two other large stakeholders and what input we could give and you can see that theres been a lot of study its been shallow but its been well thought out and the groundwork has been  has been done so were at a point where its  it needs to you know  if we dont stop and focus then its just going to get overlooked and put on a shelf and never happen and we think that that is wrong given that were getting ready to invite   23157 pm  hundreds of thousands of visitors to visit that space  champion in some places its for cars but here it is a place for people  i think they can both coexist well in that area i mean theres enough street to work with and the fact that we took congress avenue which was a nonconnecting piece of rightofway theres no turn there so you have two large medians that you know instead of just doing hatchmarks which is what is called for now and just putting another concrete median there and putting in landscaping and it doesnt have to be elaborate but it could go you know a hundred feet east and west of what is the intersection if not 150 feet and it would not affect the turn lanes for brassus and congress and you are adding that much more greenery to  i had a picture and i thought about   23258 pm  putting it there on the slide deck of  some of the pictures of what we call urban blight from the 1970s and theres several on websites that you can find of austin or looking back somewhat geographically and look at how nice austin was you look at the streets and its nothing but concrete and i show the picture of today and its the same unfortunate concrete expanse that you know  and again we all have evolved and the city is growing up and the state has converted parking lots into you know buildings that are alive with people now so its kind of time to bring the other landscape with it the street scape  with it  it would seem like there is a real need to bring together all of the different aspects that the transportation and urban design people have in mind   23359 pm  because safety will be a really big issue and i think that transit probably would also be an integral part because youre going to have people  you know i dont know what the service is today about people bringing kids and others to go to the blanton or go to the museum  theres two   theres a lot of possibilities but the right people need to be involved i dont know if that is tim or you  champion i think if we make the recommendation  what were you going to say  i think that the recommendation from utc would be great in the end for this i definitely agree you have made a considerable investment here already to make it a very attractive place for pedestrians and very comfortable for them and a great placemaking opportunity and you have 15 and mlk one of the things when listening to the presentation it seems that what we need to   23459 pm  figure out on the city side is how do we resource this effort with the hundred years of backlog with that that were doing and the fortunate  in a way blessing that weve had from the community and funding us to do a lot of capital improvement work across the city and theres a lot of needs throughout the stay but one of the things that i can take back is to talk with our group and get an answer back on how would we resource this in terms of staff to do the engagement and to do the design work and then answering that next question that comes after that and while were working on this how would we pay for that and then win you know the sooner the better and maybe theres something that we could do to some of the things that you were mentioning chris maybe we could do those sooners as we wait for more funding to come if we have to wait so i think theres definitely some opportunities there to me its a question about resourcing and i will go back to our group and get an answer  an answer to that and get back with you   23602 pm   yeah to that the city supposes that theyre doing something they have already invested a million nine and drawing some plans and were just adding some green space there which is not outside the  the citys previous efforts on 12th street and 15th street theres several medians that are all green theyre not you know elaborate but theyre green  theyre there  and theyre there and you know it might be an opportunity to you know yall put the dirt and we have put in the sweat and you know the type of opportunity there and you know i cant speak for the legislative process it gives us  the money to do these things but you know its something that we can discuss you know and say okay the city is serious and we need to be serious if were going to you know how would this be   23705 pm  structured you know is it  you know something that we participate in or is it all on the city or i cant speak to that but you know were wondering too but we want  we want to have that discussion with you guys  champion well at least   it will create problems if we dont  and theres more opportunities as well  right 400000 people coming to this area and its well order heavily trafficked with pedestrians and part of our goal is to make more placemaking opportunities in austin as part of our austin strategic mobility plan and safety is our top  is our first chapter in that plan because it really   with the emergence of all of those efforts and its a doable one you know thats not years  years and years of time and bond money you know weve all kind of teed up the ball its kind of ready to kick you know to  you   23806 pm  know to get  you know so were kind of saying lets blow the whistle and start the game  i will just let you know what the downtown commission said they did pass a resolution at their last meeting and now therefore be it resolved was to immediately to identify and to commit more  not more than 500000 for the construction of the pedestrian enhancements of the intersection of congress and mlk but it doesnt really talk about design or involvement in any of the other part of the needed work to be done and that was sent to the  the downtown commission urging the city council to direct the city managers  champion umhmm so we did come  on the dais resolution that you know whether that is specific dollars attached to it or that generally urges  i guess atd to work   23910 pm  with the board organization   the preservation board and the texas facilities commission were the responsible landowners for the state  champion yeah and well say the responsible state parties and working on the intersection of mlk and congress i guess   congress right away  champion yeah congress right away okay so we can come up with something like that but before we jump imo that detail any other commissioners who have some observations or want to practice some word smithing or any objections  indiscernible  champion can you turn on your mic  15th street we are figuring we would take it one intersection at a time but at some point i would say three years from now i could very much envision being that we have followed through on phase two and we need to  actually i would hope that we do that    24012 pm  more proactively than we have now i think that weve been a little bit flomommed on how we proceed and extend our hand and say were ready to work with you guys and the same thing at 15th and congress that is a very key intersection the traffic between capitol square and capital mall will be even greater at that location and were actively working with architects on one of the buildings they were proposing you know coming up to the lot you know to the property line and its like pull it back and were not trying to maximize some roi were trying to make a place here in that intersection has most of the buildings have a much greater setback than just the property line and we asked them to respect that and so the   24115 pm  opportunity to do something at 15th street is definitely on our minds  champion okay well i will make a motion that we propose a resolution if we agree with that we can wordsmith is there a second to proposing a resolution in support  who is going to do the resolution  well theoretically what we could do is that either way we need it in the paper form or maybe we could verbally   champion certainly we could do it in notes form and we could take it back  like last time and then ill make it official letterhead and send it  the meeting is recorded so  no worry  champion okay but generally the key bullet points is that the urban transportation commission will   24216 pm  recommend that  would it be atd or be the city of austin as the   it goes to the recommendations of seeing andrew and having atd be integrally involved  champion okay  and we bring together the different parties from the texas state preservation board ut and other departments urban design and others in that conversation  champion umhmm okay so the urban preservation board and other  necessary thats a good word necessary state of texas departments  no im speaking about the city of austin departments  but to your point the agencies  state agency  champion state agency okay to work together to find a  whatever you want   24317 pm  to call this to work together to   to recommend   champion yeah so well be recommending so utc and thats how it all began roughly recommends the city manager direct  and then we have to  figure out who is directing atd and so were going to have the state agencies to  what we want to call this  to address the placemaking opportunities at the texas capital mall specifically north congress and mlk jr boulevard intersection just taking it directly from this is that broad enough or do you think that it needs to be more specific  the placemaking is definitely a piece of it and i think that the other piece that needs to be in there is the pedestrian accommodations and more of a connection the way that chris described it as you have hit mlk and its somewhat of a barrier well lets try to soften that barrier and really provide the connection across there with the investments that have been done   24420 pm  already  champion okay  integrated pedestrian connection  champion okay so  indiscernible there so it is going to be something like  all right so the key words that i was taking because you were talking basically is  utc recommends the city manager to direct atd and other city departments to be integrally involved with the state preservation board and other state of texas agencies to work together to address the place making and the pedestrian accommodations including safe access and connection to complete the texas capitol mall project  or just texas capitol mall  pedestrian connection  because connecting to ut develop theirs on the north side  champion at north congress   24520 pm  avenue and mlk jr boulevard  and add the university of texas and austin as one of those  champion okay okay agencies   this is wordsmithing chuckle  i was going to say weve got to get alison involved and shes an english  runas dont worry i wont mention anything about the grammar today  champion give us a moment to mention my lack of capitalizations but you know in the end what will happen is that ill go home and do this okay so it is essentially this and i will read it one more time not one more time but again utc will recommend the city manager to direct atd and other city of austin departments be integrally involved with the state preservation board and other necessary state of texas agencies including ut austin   24621 pm  to work together to address the placemaking and pedestrian  hold on a second  well move that to the end to address the placemaking opportunities including safe access and pedestrian connections to complete the texas capitol mall project at north congress avenue and mlk jr boulevard something like that  and to add just a little bit more specificity to it   champion okay  i think that what commissioner weatherby of saying in terms of the collaboration but also how  the resourcing to do the design work and then   champion okay  the resourcing for implementation and just to  figure that out and in collaboration with the different parties and how will we do that  champion okay so to determine resourcing   24721 pm  and  what was the other word that you used  um resourcing for the design and implementation  champion okay the  okay all right so do another read through and from a legal standpoint chris  from a legal standpoint does it matter if its not exactly wordforword if i get home and i tweak it a little bit just for clarity  yes  champion well then let me  okay so  okay so then let me just see okay so ill read this all again the utc recommends the city manager direct atd and other city of austin departments to be integrally involved to determine resourcing for the design and implementation  i feel like the last sentence  here one   24823 pm  second because its going to be a big sort of side clause here implementation  take that back let me just read it as it is utc recommends the city manager to direct the austin transportation department and other city of austin departments to be involved to determine the design and implementation with the state preservation board and other state of texas agencies and ut austin to work together to address the safe access and pedestrian connections to complete the capital mall project at congress avenue and mlk jr boulevard  indiscernible  sorry i second that  champion all right any comments samuel  i think that sounds great  that sounds good to me  champion all right so its been a motion discussed   24924 pm  anymore discussion okay all in favor say aye or raise your hand and it was unanimous all opposed say nay any abstentions no this will become our recommendation that well make official and get moved on up the chain  we thank you very much  champion yeah well thank you for presenting and thank you for working on this for years it looks very exciting and it looks like an awesome place to visit  please come down   champion well be there okay thank you all right our final item on the list is the bike lane bounty program proposal there is in your backup and i wont change chairs since i dont really have a presentation presentation but i will give a minute or so of background context   25024 pm   so that you know where this comes from and what its value is i think so as it says in the whereas im not going to read the bullet points but i want to summarize the key elements of the whereas a successful transportation system doesnt just move cars and it moves people and there are lots of ways to move people micromobility scooters and wheelchairs and bikes all of those require safe separated bike  or safe separated infrastructure this proposal talks about bike lanes in particular because bike lanes are something that we spend money on and study after study shows that safe separated infrastructure or the perception thereof  or the lack of this is the number one reason that people when asked why dont you ride your bike more they say this is why i dont ride my bike more so thats sort of the reason for proposal at its root level and then some evidence that this kind of thing works is that second whereas the city of   25124 pm  austin in case you werent aware already does kind of a bounty reward program around disability parking spots or accessible parking spaces so this is an existing city program that is 100 in this vein and it just covers a different topic so theres nothing new there and new york city as i mentioned in the past and if you clicked on the links that are in the document new york city has had a very successful clean air program you know if you look at it if theres  you know this isnt real numbers but if you could say theres a million trucks idling for 30 minutes a day thats half a million hours of pollution per day that theyre trying to cut back on they have been successful with this program and theres some links there if you have taken the time to read them it results both in millions of dollars for the city but it also results in a lot less idling for cleaner air so this kind of bounty program works in other places theres another example in there of similar legislation that goes a little bit further and then theres three examples   25227 pm  where not even citizens are required to help enforce the ordinances and unmanned red light cameras and unmanned school bus cameras and speaking as a person who potentially their spouse has gotten a 300 ticket for going past the school bus that they didnt know that was parked that is a true thing that already happens so this set is to say that from a technical standpoint and from a cultural standpoint these are things that already happened and they just can dont happen on this topic  indiscernible  speed cameras and red light cameras because the legislature threw it out in 2019  champion now i remember that but this is more of an example  yeah these things do exist and they exist in other places yeah  indiscernible  champion no thats fine and i understand and this is setting this is not that crazy of an    25327 pm  idea and the last whereas theres good outcomes the city spends millions of dollars and that is to make these facilities and these facilities get blocked all the time i ran into councilmember paige ellis at an event and i was talking to her about this and she said on that very day which was the start of biketowork month or whatever it was that the councilmembers went out on a bike ride just as sort of a showcase opportunity and ran into multiple people in the bike lanes like its a thing if you dont ride your bike downtown you may not be aware of this but it is a thing that is constant it is constant and you can go on twitter and find examples  are scooters victims  champion scooters are vehicles but theyre allowed to be in the bike lanes  indiscernible  champion you have to turn on your mic sorry  are scoots allowed to be lying down in the bike lane   25428 pm   champion theyre not supposed to be lying down in the bike lane but for people thats probably a different topic about how people handle the scooters  can we change the language of the vehicles and other obstacles  champion i would love to focus  thats something that is detectable or traceable to a person and the problem with the scooter in the bike lane and that theres no recourse to know who that is if you see a scooter in the bike lane it could be there for any number of reasons and i couldnt tell you who put it there with a car and a license plate i can tell you who is responsible for that car so then the last part that i want to point out is the be it further resolved theres three things that additionally would need to happen to make this viable if you dont know the city ordinance currently says that you can only get a ticket for obstructing a bike lane that says theres a sign that says   25528 pm  you cant obstruct the bike lane you cant block a bike lane unless theres a sign that says for whatever reason that you can park in this bike lane the city has opposite ordinance and thats crazy to me but it does and that needs to change and the city needs to make people aware of that because it would be a change and also make people aware that you can actually get a citation in my brief surveying of people nobody thinks that you can do that and i think that is part of a problem people dont think that its a citable offense to block the bike lane but the and the last bullet points are aimed at changing some underpinnings that a make it seem culturally acceptable and also take in my opinion the opposite stance which defaults to being sort of okay to block a bike lane so that is a quick overview and i dont really have a presentation but i guess that ill make a motion that   im sorry real quick   25629 pm   before  i want to make it aware to the other commissioners that the google link to this document is in the calendar invite i dont see anyone else on there but i just got nervous its in the calendar invite if you look for it i want to introduce jason redfern here with city staff to just discuss this if he so chooses his division i believe would handle a lot of the implementation of this but jason correct me on that if im wrong but i didnt get a chance to introduce him so sorry about that  its quite all right chris no we do enforce the regulatory signage that prevents people from parking in bike lanes so the tow away zones with the placards and the signage so we have over the last two years cited over 1200 vehicles   25731 pm  and weve towed 230 vehicles out of the bike lanes so far  champion yes that is good to know okay so well get to discussions here in a moment first we have to make a motion and move this into the discussion stage i will make a motion that we approve this recommendation  or that we have this recommendation is there a second so that we can discuss it  i will second  championi saw her raise her hand so lets move into discussion who has any discussion items yes  and i agree that no one can use bike lanes but without knowing what the ramifications of this are and i understand   25832 pm  that you are citing the positive effects but where else is it done and what are the negative effects right i would like to know both sides there before i vote on this issue like anything theres always some sort  you know theres always collateral damage and i would like to know what that possibly could be for lamenting this i wouldnt want to paint austinites as austinites put it that way and people pointing fingers at each other  id like to know what the potential negative ramifications of this has been in other cities before we move forward just saying that this is the golden ticket and the only way to solve this issue  champion well a good question and i wouldnt say its the only way to solve the issue and its an additional way to solve this issue theres not enough traffic enforcement staff and this is not a place that police need to be involved in or something like that the ordinances are the ordinances and it is already a citeable offense but a lot of   25932 pm  people seem to not know that its a citable offense and its just really spreading the workload just like the accessible parking spot theres just too many accessible parking spots for them to be governed in some way by city staff you know and its a pretty low risk endeavor to say hey theres someone in the  bike lane like its a low risk endeavor to say hey youre in the parking spot that youre not supposed to be in and there are negatives that i need to do this   30313 pm   i was going to mention that we have a program for delivering vehicles that if they need to deliver during certain times of the day they can take a lane of traffic versus parking in a bike lane and thats a permanent program so thats one solution if you do move to council you know to do a widespread ban of parking in a bike lane and then move to a permissions model where in those specific areas where there is a need that you could do permissive signage versus restrictive so that is a part of the program i did want to mention our ada volunteer program that you mentioned is  it is fairly successful there are some limitations to the program that  for example that there are state regulations that back up the fact that there is the ability for volunteers to issue citations and they still have to follow the procedure of serving the citation for the   30415 pm  vehicle and for them to participate as a volunteer and i know the bounty program kind of suggests that there may be some sort of a benefit so the state legislation that  i think its texas transportation code 681 privileged parking and it talks about volunteers have to meet certain criteria for you know certain age restrictions they still have to serve the you know the citation to the vehicle and so the  and they cant accept anything because its a completely volunteer basis i just wanted to bring that up  chair yeah thank you for bringerring up those specific details and this program is different from that in that the 311 app is used to report the infraction and the city is still entirely responsible for deciding if thats a citable offense or not and the city could decide for   30516 pm  the first six months were sending those people application to the permit process that you just talked about and say hey this is your warning and youre going to start getting a ticket if you keep doing this heres our way around that please follow the rules so that would be totally fine i think that would come up in the details as this would get implemented the goal of the recommendation is that is there a way to get citizen involvement into pursuing unobstructed bike lanes thats the core part of it i just want to add one bullet point in the be it resolved is sort of what youre talking about is that the signage  i think there needs to be an effort to clarify in signage what is available or what is allowable and what is not allowable  people they just dont know and they think that its okay or theyve seen it somewhere else shoal creek for example a lot of that bike lane is parkble before the new bike lane got    30616 pm  put in two years ago or so people parked in the bike lane because it was allowed and so thats  how would they know that its no longer allowed and so im going to stop there unless theres more questions yes  one more question i guess this is a personal reading of it but would you be amenable to taking bounty out of the title bounty is a little bit radioactive at the moment  chair yeah bike lane bounty was alliterative  supporting the like lane enforcement program  chair im sure the press will still call it bike lane bounty  other programs were eliminated  chair do you have a suggestion bike lane   enforcement  chair bike lane citizens bike lane   enforcement  chair or reporting or   30717 pm  something like that totally yeah bike lane bounty was literally   i think it would be the bike rider who would have the incentive to do this  chair oh 100 yeah we call this citizens bike lane  i dont know if enforcement is the right word reporting we go with just a very utility title program im totally amenable to that so the change would be then instead of being called the bike lane bounty program it would be the citizen bike lane reporting program yeah  thanks  chair im totally fine with that  chair one last question i would be a little more comfortable with as opposed to  in the be it resolved the utc recommends that council members implement a program what about study the feasibility of implementing a program such as this   30817 pm  like giving us more information on like jason pointed out is this even legal what does state law say about this  chair so the develop  i mean i would rather go with something like undertake to develop and if that undertaking turns out for legal reasons this cant be done then we can come back and make the necessary tweaks but our recommendation to study  i fear that it would just get lost at the study level whereas if they undertake to develop or something like that then you know  and in the end this is just a recommendation council will do whatever council does would you be okay with it like undertake to develop  sure sure sure well i guess what im saying is three months if they look into this and three months they come back and say this is actually the ramifications  these are our hurdles that were having to get over and this is what weve seen in other cities the collateral   30919 pm   damage potentially or not  chair right  its 100 improve the bike lanes and were much more mobile now and everybodys happy  chair yeah we might find three other cities somewhere that have done this yes mr redfern  maybe a phased recommendation because i think everybody has agreed that parking in a bike lane is not you know people dont like it and i dont know if your recommendation maybe is a phased recommendation so that the larger thing is that we recommend that number one the city of austin directs the city manager to you know make it illegal to park in a bike lane and then there are other pieces to this recommendation because i think that number one piece about parking in the bike lane is pretty important and if the other things dont work if the other things like we go through the legal department and there are impediments the main thing is potentially addressed   31020 pm  through enforcement staff that can and so just you know thinking about the restrictive versus permissive and maybe making that a multipart recommendation  chair yeah so im just trying to imagine how to do that specifically potentially i mean i think the bullet points under the be it further resolved i think thats sort of what youre getting at those really are stages along the way and you know and whether it matters or not i dont know to city council or the city manager as it comes to it i mean i dont have a problem saying that these three things kind of need to happen for this fourth thing to happen the fourth one is currently the thing thats shown first so flipping those around and saying you know we should undertake to try to do these three things so the fourth one can happen im totally fine with that   31120 pm  personally because it gets to the same outcome its just if thats clearer to how we get to that outcome do any other commissioners have feelings on that okay so then what i would say is are you in the document right now or should i be in the document because im just going to copy and paste this in a different direction  im in the document you can do whatever you like though thats fine  chair let me just add this phrase all right so im just going to swap out the be it resolved and the be it further resolved because i think the fair statement which is true they need to happen first the overall one cant happen unless this happened 100 agreed all right so the change of people not looking at the document in the what was be it resolved is now the be it further resolved   31221 pm  i did add that they undertake to develop and that gives the flexibility of a bit of wiggle room as to whether or not they have to develop this or they just have to figure out how to develop it and the  phasing of the first three bullet points on which the fourth which is now the be it further resolved depends are these other things if all three of them happen it would be great and if for some reason the last step cant happen then well bring it back up and say why cant it happen okay with that any other questions comments athena do you have any other comments as cosponsor  not right now  chair all right i guess we can just move to the vote then we dont have to do a new   correct  chair all right all those in favor of the recommendation now known as the  oh hold on since were here live let me   31322 pm  change it from bike lane bounty ill call it formerly known as  the program formerly known as citizens   it will catch on dont worry it sounds just as good its even more delightful  chair we need to craft an acronym like thor or something  what about bike lane blockage  see i knew allison  chair there you go bike lane blockage program yeah unblockage program  does that sound as cool i dont know  chair citizen bike lane blockage program oh i think just actually drop the citizen would that be okay bike lane blockage program okay its still got some easy ring to it thats the most important   31423 pm  part next well spend ten minutes discussing the font so all those in favor of the bike lane blockage program recommendation raise your hand or say aye theres six all opposed say nay or abstentions 60 oh 70 sorry allies here 70 with that thank yall very much this is exciting well see what happens next on our agenda is time for the briefings first up downtown commission  the program that we had today was the entire program of the downtown commission that needed to be brought up thank you very much  chair all right joint sustainability  i do not see commissioner wheeler  yes diana is absent today apologies i should have announced that   31525 pm  earlier  chair bicycle advisory no thats commissioner athena leyton  oh sorry i wasnt able to make it the last meeting because i had a conflict so i just checked their notes last time i checked there were no slides there was a joint meeting with the pedestrian advisory council that updates on the metro bike signal detection failures and a walkbike presentation  chair okay thank you pedestrian advisory commissioner runs  they canceled their meeting yesterday so i have nothing else to add to that  chair okay the mobility committee so i attended the beginning of that i gave a report on what we had done at our last meeting after that they were having the metro bike  im  looking at the thing now and it looks like they had the same presentation we had plus an update from the city manager on strategic mobility outcomes   31626 pm  i did not attend that one was there anything exciting in that  no they did get the same metro bike presentation and a couple of other bikerelated items but nothing else thats really major  chair okay thank you and then commissioner susan somers with the transit partnership board  yeah i actually couldnt make  we canceled in april i couldnt make it to the may meeting because i had my childs orchestra concert turns out that meeting ended up not convening because of quorum so they havent met  they met twice in march but they havent met since march so there is a meeting on thursday of that body so i will have an update for our next utc  chair thank you and with that we are down to future agenda items we have a list if you have looked at your document tdm update signal timing right of way information brief walnut creek special events   31727 pm  is there anything anyone feels strongly about that they would like to include in an upcoming meeting  i do want to take the time to acknowledge samuel franco or commissioner franco  you know your item for the south central waterfront regulating plan i have been in contact with staff we hope to get that to you all in july they just need a little bit more time from the presentation that they gave to you all they do intend to come to you all though it will more than likely just be in july they couldnt make it this time in regards to the scooters item the atd staff is very aware of the many incidents happening with scooters staff is working on it now they also need just a little bit more time we hope to get that item to you and give a full presentation on what weve done in august i know that might be more of a delay but again we are very aware of whats going on and were  staff has informed me   31827 pm  that theyre trying to fix it as quickly as they can so in regards to those future items i just wanted to make those announcements i have a few more announcements but ill wait  chair i think were getting very close to being done any announcements need to happen before adjournment  yes  chair the floor is yours  briefly if everyone could in no way shape or form am i trying to get from your business but if you could let me know if you are going on vacation in the summer i would very much appreciate it it just helps me ensure that we have quorum i think the worst thing on the planet outside of a lot of different things but for this commission the worst thing to happen is to not meet quorum if youre going on vacation and you have that planned out i would appreciate you letting me  know in advance just to make sure we have quorum and if not i can let everyone know ahead of time and we can hopefully save a lot of time speaking of vacation   31928 pm  july 5th is our next meeting date i recognize of course that that is after july 4th in hindsight maybe this next november we can schedule better i dont know but i will be on vacation from june 5th to july  im sorry june 17th to july 5th im getting married so   chair congratulations  so if you dont hear from me between then were still going to have all the backups the calendar taken care of if you do see one or two backups that are late i apologize now im not ignoring you my future wife will take my phone and yeah but yeah i just

july 5th ill have a red carpet lights maybe some fireworks and shell come in blazing hopefully shes watching now  chair no pressure  off mic  no no no it will be fine i just wanted to make you all aware of those things if you have anything else in the meantime let me know and ill get it on the agenda thank you  i have a suggestion for a future agenda item im curious about how many people are involved in scooter accidents with a car turning right on red and i dont know who would be able to provide information on that but obviously the scooters arent running into themselves  okay i will check in with staff on that and well see what we can do  chair and then finally for the many many people watching   32130 pm  at home wheres your wedding registry if they need to go buy you things  no dont worry about that i do want to apologize though for starting late city council was still in executive session and we ran into a few issues but we got it all resolved thank you all for being patient with that  off mic  yes mayor steve adler actually i met him for the first time today it was amazing at least i saw him walk by to adjourn the meeting  chair you visually met him  it was a wonderful experience yes  chair with that i think  unless there are any lastminute items that people need to throw out for discussion nope okay then last item is adjournment i think we can do that by consensus unless anyone objects we are adjourned thank you all    60230 pm   commissioners it looks that we do have a quorum present item going to take roll just for the record here cathy i see you amanda there you go thank you albert swantner all right melissa rothrock jonathan barona ethan meyers kaiba white i see you right there thank you lets see ian there you are thank you and ingrid powell there you are looks like we do have a quorum and we can begin this meeting and if anyone else logs in they can certainly join us let me see here you know commissioners the agenda tonight was pretty   60331 pm  straightforward it was a simple meeting i think were mainly going to be focused on the update to the comprehensive master plan having said that i would love to get started by going through the first item the approval of minutes from the may 11th meeting and commissioners if anybody has any questions on those or would like to make a motion i will accept that kaiba   white i move approval  acuna all right do i hear a second  chair ill second  acuna ian seconds all right hearing no discussion on this i hope all those in favor please   60434 pm  raise your hand wave do something thank you commissioners it passes unanimously thanks guys next item is the new business arrs rca on the vehicle wrap of the trucks and that item itself is  there was an rca included in the actual package for us to look over and i think ken  who was going to speak to that item chad chad are you there  yes i am  acuna thank you chad  can you see me  acuna yes i can now thank you  good evening commissioners my name is chad presley chief administrative officer for austin resource recovery here tonight before you to request a recommendation for item number 222060 an authorization to award a contract to eagle eye partners inc to provide wraps   60536 pm  and installation services for our vehicles the contract would have a term of five years not to exceed 3085430 and im happy to answer any questions you may have  acuna thank you chad commissioners any questions commissioner white  white yeah im wondering what is done with the wraps when they are removed  that is a very good question im assuming we would recycle them these are vinyl wraps so we would be able to recycle them  acuna was that a trick question  commissioner white  tammy williams that is correct we would recycle the wraps  acuna thank you tammy any other questions  yeah it was in a way the right   60637 pm  answer but the added information that its vinyl concerns me thats a particularly toxic material to produce is there any other option for wrapping vehicles that is not vinyl  we can research that we havent made up the actual wraps itself so we can certainly research that commissioner white its not a problem for us  white so this contract would not lock you into a certain type of wrap  no the actual artwork for this contract has not been designed its been designed but we havent made up the material we could research that to see what other materials are out there  acuna im sorry go ahead assuming there is something out there  an alternative to the vinyl obviously or im assuming that that would affect the cost on this  it could if thats the case we would have to bring it back   60737 pm  there was one sole bidder we could go back to see if that has an effect they asked for a mockup of one of our designs wed have to check to see how that could affect the actual contract and victoria reeger might be on she might be able to give additional information since we provided the mockup and didnt have the artwork for them to attach which is normally  wed have to see what would happen to the contract  acuna thank you tammy any other questions commissioners  white im a little confused so youre saying you dont knowwhether or not this company can do other types of wraps or not  so this company  all we did for this particular contract is we provided a mockup of what we wanted to see on the actual vehicle itself so our graphic designer designed what arr would like to see give mockups it doesnt mean thats the final   60838 pm  product in terms of what would be on the vehicle itself so i dont know that the artwork is the final thing that youll see on the final attachment so there is some room for us to negotiate how that likes victoria may be able to add additional information thats up in the air because the artwork  the wrap is part of the actual price of the contract but the  what it looks like and how its attached may not have been part of the contract itself so we may have the ability to look at some of those things and finalize that piece of it does that make sense  white i think i understand but that doesnt address my concern my concern is not about the artwork its about  it seems like this contract  theyre offering a physical product  acuna kaiba youre breaking in and out im sorry  white sorry  hi commissioner ken    60939 pm  director austin resource recovery i think i can answer your question the quote for this particular item was provided to us as a vinyl material i think what director williams is saying is that we could ask them if its possible to do this in a different material i will say that the typical standard material for this  because of the durability fading factors and that sort of thing  vinyl is kind of one of the hallmarks the standards of that industry but we could ask if there are other materials that we could use in place of vinyl something that might be more recyclable once these  the wraps are removed and if we decide to put a new wrap on to advertise something that were doing or something that were promoting that type of thing we can ask that if they have an alternative material  acuna thank you director commissioners any other   61039 pm  questions it sounds as though we do have a question here and the fact is the trucks are waiting to be decalled is that correct the fleet is in need   we have some that are and this also covers new trucks as well so through the next five years this would cover the inventory that we currently have already and then also any new purchases  acuna hypothetically speaking how long would it take to get an answer back from the contractor  we could have something back by the next meeting for sure  acuna and that wouldnt cause a problem to defer something like this  not at this point i think we have enough time because we made allowances for both new trucks and existing trucks so we have time this is a brand new endeavor were still building this thing we have some time to still work with the contractor that bid on   61140 pm  the job  acuna would that be comfortable for this commission to perhaps we view  review other options commissioners  yeah it would be great to hear what other materials would cost if there are suitable materials and what their pros and cons might be  acuna thank you commissioners so ill  im sorry commissioner gattuso  gattuso yes so it sounded like   acuna cathy you can speak up  sorry  gattuso can you hear me  acuna a little bit yes  gattuso okay i dont know what else to do  acuna there you go  gattuso maybe the chemicals in the vinyl as well as is being recycled  white yeah   61240 pm   its a particularly toxic material so even if its recycled its one of those things that i think unless theres a real strong need that its the only thing that can do a task that really needs to be done then i think vinyl should be avoided its not an environmentally friendly material  and mr snipes when you check on this mr snipes can you find out the cost of these wraps hopefully theres other materials that can be used  commissioner gattuso absolutely ill check to see what other materials they have or what they might recommend and try to figure out the pros and cons if they do have another material of both  gattuso okay thank you and then mr acuna will put that   61340 pm  on the agenda for next month  acuna yes absolutely just out of curiosity ken or tammy or someone chad what are the trucks currently labeled  what type of decal material is on there now  all they have on them now is just the city of austin seal  acuna nothing to this extent  nothing at all  acuna all right commissioners so i guess we are going to be deferring this item and i dont believe we need a motion to do that or to vote on that  just really quick then unless im mistaken have we seen  it may be worthwhile for us to  since were going to review this anyway to get an idea of what the mockup looked like and an idea of what the intent is here of what they look like today versus what they will look like with the new decal or new wraps   61442 pm   acuna great idea we had that conversation earlier and it would be a wonderful opportunity to show the decal on the next  as a next agenda item if we could add that on there too  sure  acuna all right commissioners thank you were going to defer this item until our next meeting the next item of business is the actual comprehensive plan update and i think the presenters on that are jason selene gena and who else tammy  again tammy williamson assistant director austin resource recovery tonight wed like to give you an update on the progress weve made on the zero waste comprehensive plan for those that are newer on the commission this is an update to our existing waste  zero waste master plan that council adopted in 2011   61542 pm  the zero waste master plan established the goal of zero waste by 2040 over the past decade we are proud that our department and the community have made  progress that weve made together to achieve our goal so far so like the rollout weve done a few things like the rollout of the curbside composting plan that weve got and the policies  other policies that weve managed to get weve rolled out to the community to help us get closer to this zero zero waste goal the city is growing and challenging were facing challenges like mobility affordability and more so in order to continue our  mission to protect the people and the planet the plan update takes into account that growth and the built and natural environment during tonights presentation youll hear an overview of the community engagements efforts and what weve heard as well as some of the focus groups in this   61643 pm  updated plan tonight wed like to welcome your feedback and look forward to your support and assistance in meeting the zero waste goal with that ill turn it over to selene castillo to walk you through this presentation i know youll be riveted to hear what she has to say  laughing   all right well hello everyone im selene castillo like tammy said and i have been managing this project from the arr side as you know we hired some consultants to help complete this update and they were not able to attend today but obviously theyve played a major role in this project and the last time that you all received an update from this project was actually delivered by them   61745 pm  next slide okay so since its been a minute since that presentation happened im going to start with a very highlevel recap of the process that weve been following up to this point and then ill dive a little deeper into one area of this project which is community engagement then well talk about arrs newly developed racial equity tool and how we intend to use this tool for our planned initiatives then well get into those initiatives and those goals we wont be covering every single idea goal rationale around the comprehensive plan tonight because well be here for hours but instead were going to focus on those goals that are most relevant to this group and ill explain what i mean by that in a little bit then well discuss the connections that this plan has with the climate equity plan and the projects next steps   61847 pm  and we will close with questions since there is a good bit of ground to cover im going to put a little bit of emphasis on waiting to the end for any questions please next slide okay so our recap the consultant started by doing research both on our city and other cities and analysis to develop recommendations for how austin can achieve zero waste so the consultants and the departments leadership team discussed those recommendations through a series of workshops and meetings and that informed the plans drafting while the research and the discussions were happening with the consultants and arr staff another  a subset if you will  of consultants and arr team were leading the community engagement efforts and those conversations and those efforts also informed the   61947 pm   drafting of the plan so weve gone through several dafting rounds now with the consultants and with staff and we are now nearing the end of that drafting process so that was a birdseye view of where we are next slide please okay now lets zoom into the specific topic of community engagement so the first point i want to make is that our community engagement efforts changed from what was originally planned back in 2019 since obviously 2020 brought a pandemic that were still grappling with so we shifted to using two tools that could lend themselves well to both a virtual format and an inperson format if and when public health guidelines allowed that to happen so one of those tools was a survey which youre looking at right now so we did two rounds of surveys   62048 pm  one in 2020 and the other one in 2021 so for the first round we distributed surveys online through speakup austin and austin energy since inperson engagement activities were not being encouraged at the time of the pandemic in the fall of 2020 even though we couldnt get out on the streets to collect survey responses we still received almost 3000 responses from the community which we very much welcomed and appreciated given the other priorities that the world was dealing with at that time next slide okay so when we looked at who was responding to the survey we noticed that participation varied across districts and by and large thats normal but some districts had almost double the number of responses than others so the arr   62150 pm  communications team staff developed a plan to relaunch the survey and target specifically those districts where responses were lower during the first survey round and the districts that they targeted are highlighted in yellow so were talking about school districts 2 3 4 and 6 next slide please staff launched a series of marketing campaigns using digital radio print and television ads and these ads were strategically used on platforms that the team understood to be frequented by members of the four target districts additionally staff reached out to several organizations that were either in these districts or they served the communities in these districts so these organizations are the ones listed on the slide and include places of worship grocery stores ymcas and   62251 pm  farmers markets next slide okay so this is a timeline of the outreach done by the arr team and what i wanted to point out here more than anything is that as soon as staff could safely attend inperson engagement events we did the blue squares and the blue circles both symbolize an inperson activity  like tabling at a community event and both of those activities were triggered by the yellow sun well call it which was aph calling a stage 2 next slide okay so these graphs represent the results of survey participation after our second round of surveying the community if you look at the graph on the left were talking about participation by council   62353 pm  district so council districts that had the lower participation in the first round if you recall were districts 2 3 4 and 6 and two of those districts now became our highestparticipation districts in the second round namely districts 6 and 4 then the graph on the right represents participation based on selfreported race and ethnicity we did not track this parameter in the first round but we included it here because the demographics of the districts with the originally low participation show a high hispaniclatino or spanish population and this graph shows that we were able to engage with that community next slide okay this is my last chart slide so on the left side we can see that overall we had a mostly   62453 pm  online submission for surveys but the split was fairly close and considering that we were only able to distribute paper surveys for less than a month this breakdown shows that there is still a use and success in doing ontheground engagement theres still a population to be served that does not live online then on the right side we have the language in which the survey was filled out the related stats to this graph is that according to the us census about 30 of austinites speak another language besides english at home and austinites who speak english less than very well is about 11 so we tried to accommodate community members who do not consider english their primary language and people did take those surveys and we were able to consider their input next slide and that leads us to overall   62554 pm  input from everyone who participated with the survey so we asked them about their diversion habits what they knew about arr services what they used from arr services and also what they wanted if we made more dropoff facilities and this is what we heard back so the majority of survey participants reported always or frequently practicing at least four of the five diversion activities that we listed for them so these are recycling reusing repairing and donating items the majority of the respondents didnt have knowledge of the zero waste block leader program and the clothing and housewares curbside collection program about half of respondents had used the arr doc or are using it and the most desired additional dropoff option was having    62654 pm  several dropoff centers at places like libraries and city facilities next slide okay so the second type of engagement tool that we used were focus groups and line the surveys  like the surveys we did two rounds one in 2020 and the other in 2021 the first round was focused on stakeholders like nonprofit organizations businesses and property managers we spoke with 38 participants during that round the second round was focused on our residents and we spoke with 50 participants there for all of the sessions we had a trained facilitator that was not city staff leading these discussions next slide please   62757 pm  one more back please or not okay well ill just tell you what was on that slide okay so that slide was the major takeaways from the focus group discussions and it basically said the majority of the feedback that we received during those focus groups centered around education so our participants were knowledgeable about arrs main services but they mentioned the need for clear repetitive and consistent education and messaging which is something that weve also heard from a few commissioners here so that lines up they also suggested building awareness about our classes rebates and any programming to increase participation in addition to the education   62900 pm  focus the stakeholderspecific focus groups heavily mentioned an interest in collaborative opportunities with arr whether that looks like technical assistance or perhaps a more comprehensive partnership on a project or a program focused on zero waste and as we work towards the end of this project arr staff and also our consultants will be working to update the public on progress and results and ill talk more about that towards the end of the presentation okay so now were on the slide that i can talk about now were shifting to talking about the content of the plan so these are the chapters that we intend to include in the plan we are  like i said were not going to mention and go over every single one today instead were going to focus on the goals where your   63002 pm  participation and support would make the most impact and if youre particularly interested in a topic that youre seeing here and we dont cover today im happy to give you more information on it after this meeting okay next slide please okay so to meet the goals set in this plan well be using our  developed racial equity tool to ensure that we are delivering equitable services and programs to our community we began developing this tool in early fy21 so around october of 2020 and we modeled it after other racial equity tools that had been used by other cities teams and organizations like the ones that are listed here we also asked for and received feedback from several sources including internal arr staff arr leadership other city   63104 pm  departments external organizations and subject experts to craft our tool next slide please  chuckling    63204 pm   should i just keep going sure ill be louder when i say next slide so that everybody can move oh okay  acuna commissioners just for the record i think we all should have a copy of the actual presentation  okay  acuna there it is okay  yes we do have it  acuna thank you  okay i think were one more please okay yes okay so the purpose of this tool is to provide a process and questions to guide staff in the development the implementation and also the evaluation of our external arr initiatives our publicfacing initiatives to identify and address impacts on racial equity and i want to emphasize that   63305 pm  this tool is only intended to be used for new publicfacing initiatives so its very much one tool in a toolbox that we intend to grow this one is the one that is more relevant to the conversation today with our comprehensive plan including publicfacing initiatives okay next slide please so the first goal we want to share is regarding our curbside services and that is exploring the option of assessing additional fees for arr customers who repeatedly place trash in their recycling and composting carts so this is a longterm goal meaning were talking about a five to tenyear period to achieve and develop and weve started by  wed be starting by doing periodic waste audits of recycling collection routes in the event that a fee is   63408 pm   deemed the best route to address contamination in recycling and composting carts that fee would come to zwac to receive support next slide please okay the next goal is related to our community services or our litter abatement division so this goal is aiming to address challenges that are on the ground litter abatement team experiences when theyre doing their work around our city this goal in particular would require partnering with internal stakeholders like austin transportation and of courseen gauging  engaging with external stakeholders this is also a five to tenyear goal and again any proposed ordinance language would come to zwac for support on its way to council next slide please okay   63508 pm  so the bigger picture goal here would be to develop a transfer station clearly more is needed to develop a transfer station than getting a permit approval but we wanted to focus your attention on the part of that extensive process that would benefit from your support which is the goal listed here so the overarching goal of developing a transfer station is nearterm meaning arr would aim to begin work in the next five years and i wanted to give a brief reminder or perhaps new piece of information for new commissioners that a transfer station is a facility where trash recycling or compostable material is temporarily held and its consolidated there to haul to a landfill or processing facility its a tool used by other large cities in texas like san antonio houston and dallas due to the efficiency it can bring to the collection and hauling   63610 pm  process austin does not use a transfer station currently and that has been placing a strain on collection vehicle maintenance and also negatively affecting road wear the development of a transfer station is also linked to the use of electric collection vehicles you heard this from our director and staff to implement electric collection vehicles transfer stations would necessary to reduce that travel time of those vehicles there will be many moving parts to achieve this goal the way that you can help and be involved is through your support of an permit for a transfer station next slide please so the next goal has also been mentioned previously to this   63711 pm  group and that is to study a commercial collection system approach with the goal of minimizing negative environmental impacts enhancing data collection and promoting consistency and accountability and here were talking about studying different collection systems for the commercial waste stream one of which is a franchise system the topic was discussed at length in the last project update and we heard your feedback on wanting more information we also want more information and  that is what this study aims to provide once that study is finalized arr would have public stakeholder meetings focused on the report findings and during that part of this timeline is where wed request your help in getting participation for these public meetings i believe also at the last meeting there was a request for meetings to be not only geared for stakeholders with a business   63811 pm  interest but also for the public at large and that is something that we can collaboratively make happen once we reach that point in terms of timing arr would plan for the study component to be started in the coming five years next slide please okay so the department has a number of goals related to the universal recycling ordinance that youd be able to support and be part of since were dealing with an ordinance and any policy change again would come to zwac and for this ordinance in particular wed also be discussing it in the uro committee so the first two goals listed here are nearterm goals meaning the department would intend to start work on them in the coming five years and the last two goals listed are longterm goals meaning they have an extended start date beyond those five years so the first goal is to address   63913 pm  collection services and diversion requirements right now the uro does not include information specifically on valle collection services and with that style of collection present in the community arrs intent here is really to prevent or to reduce confusion regarding a propertys requirements for diversion and how to be in compliance the next goal is to explore the development of a multifamily composting policy so arr would intend to use the results of the multifamily composting pilot and research on peer city policies to determine how best to increase access to composting for multifamily residents and this would of course also be passed through a public stakeholder engagement process to receive valuable community   64013 pm  input then moving into our longerterm goals for the uro arr would establish  or evaluate tiered uro diversion requirements and by tiered requirements we mean establishing baseline service and diversion activity requirements for all businesses across the board and then establishing supplemental diversion requirements based on information like the type of business the size of the business or perhaps the rate at which it generates waste wed also look at having alternative requirements for some business types that are more on the unconventional side like mobile food vendors and then the last goal on this slide is to expand organics requirements beyond foodpermitted businesses currently only businesses holding a food permit from austin public health are affected by the universal    64116 pm  recycling ordinances organics diversion requirements however there is potential for us to divert additional organic material from the waste stream by including nonpermitted businesses with a steady flow of organic material and this again would be a longerterm goal looking at five to ten years for development with an extensive stakeholder engagement process next slide please okay so on the construction and demolition ordinance we have two nearterm goals the first is to explore changes to the qualified processor rules so currently effective projects have the option to use a qualified processor which has its diversion rates verified by a third party arr would explore the option of requiring all projects to use a qualified processor in order to   64217 pm  improve the accuracy of information reported to the city and also to incentivize other processors to increase diversion rates the second goal is to consider diversion requirements for key materials and in order to do that arr would conduct research and work with stakeholders closely to identify which materials have a strong local and market and those would be our identified key materials and for both of these goals once again if the outcome was an actual ordinance change we would like with the uro come to zwac seeking your support and in particular for the construction and demolition changes we would also be discussing this in the c  d committee next slide please   64317 pm  okay so that wrapped up the arrspecific goals that we wanted to share with you all now were going to look at how the comprehensive plan aligns with the climate equity plan so the climate equity plan has a series of goals of its own the ones that you see listed here are the ones that arr is supporting through current or future work so these span a communitywide per capita disposal rate ensuring all austinites can access a food system that minimizes food waste reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the electrification of vehicles next slide please so these are some of the specific actions that arr is taking or plans to take to work towards achieving the goals set in the climate equity plan   64418 pm  and ill go through them quickly so were expanding bulk pickup or the oncall program citywide developing a furniture reuse bank advising the office of sustainabilitys food waste root cause analysis  creating sustainable purchasing guidelines through the circular cities program expanding the circular economy program initiatives and last but not least exploring alternative fuels for fleet vehicles next slide please okay so the next steps for this project are that arr and consultants will finalize the draft plan this summer and then return to zwac and other boards and commissions for review this   64519 pm  fall in parallel our communications team will be sharing a draft plan with the public at large and also with residents who participated in our engagement activities through several outlets including speakup austin social media our zero waste block leaders and individual emails we intend to  just to kind of wrap this up  we intend to have an approved updated comprehensive plan by the end of this calendar year so you will be seeing and hearing more from this project in the coming months as we work our way towards council approval  acuna thank you selene thank you very much  thank you  acuna staff thank you for the presentation commissioners ill open this up for questions at this time i personally have quite a few questions and comments but nonetheless ill defer mine   64621 pm  any questions hearing none then i can hopefully chime in here but you know great plan great opportunities here to say the least ive got a couple of questions here the curbside services yes contamination is a major issue when it comes to recycling collection in fact with the pandemic we probably found a greater amount of contaminants in the recycling containers having said that i know that other cities as you stated have gone to a  i guess a fine system and im curious how thats working i know corpus christi houston i think even san antonio have gone to that fine mechanism and i would love an update on the challenges they have faced and how thats progressed and has it actually cleaned up the containers themselves   64723 pm   chair ken snipes austin resource recovery director i cant speak specifically to those particular cities  houston corpus christi etc but i do have some experience with fees for contamination you know to help resolve you know or i should say to help modify behavior right from what people are doing we is are seen it be  i have seen it be successful we talked a bit about a here but we just havent made a decision on whether we move forward with that or not were certainly open to it and can certainly explore it and its something that we can definitely look into but as far as what the other cities have seen in terms of performance improvements i cant speak to that  acuna in the future maybe in a few months we can get an update on how that has progressed and has it been received by the public if possible and thank you for that for answering that    64823 pm  my other comment too is the actual facilities that are needed here  weve talked about a transfer station obviously that is a needed item if were going to reach our potential when i say potential that includes a lot of different items  the electric vehicle fleet before you can begin that youve got to have a place to charge these guys and theyre not going to make it  not going to make a collection route on one charge with the loads that theyre carrying i would love to see us progress faster than five years on at least identifying a site and literally perhaps begin this process because the sooner we do that i think the greater the opportunity is for us to lower cost and to achieve more  literally a better more efficient collection program and thats just my two cents and please feel free to comment   64925 pm  on that  yeah chair we share the same point there what i think wed be looking at is hopefully that would be on the high end of the max of what wed be looking at were already canvassing the city looking for properties that might be suitable so that process as you know when you start the process of siting a transfer station theres a lot that goes into that  feasibility studies consistent use etc so were in the early stages of trying to find a property and have looked at a couple nothing solid yet but we are definitely trying to do what we can to identify potential properties were early in that process and i couldnt say today that well have a property by a given date because as you know the price of property in austin is at an alltime high so were wrestling with that as well weve had a couple properties that weve had our eyes on and before we could even get a review or anything started the   65027 pm  property is sold already so were wrestling with that right now so well continue to inform the commission as to where we are on that process  acuna i echo the challenges of finding property here so that leads me to my next comment again would something like this be a great opportunity for a publicprivate partnership and again i say our goal is in the northeast corridor  yeah i think so im sorry go ahead  acuna no i was going to say we can at least begin that conversation why not take advantage and look at every potential opportunity that is out there again do we have to reinvent the wheel or is it already with spokes and perhaps we just need to air up the tire  well as we said we definitely need a transfer station and a system here not having one has major ramifications on what were doing now as we talked about before the   65127 pm   wear and tear on our fleet is pretty high because were driving so many miles to tip our loads we talked about the inability to maximize our green fleet initiatives in terms of electrifying the fleet and just in general even with internal combustion engines reducing the overall carbon footprint would be another benefit of transfer stations as well so routing efficiency  as we start to get more and more densification in the city our people are spending more and more time driving as opposed to collecting right they drive to the landfill and back to the route to continue the work so theyre spending tremendous  i guess personnel hours in traffic in a lot of cases so we certainly need it in our system a city this size should definitely have one if not more and so its definitely a top priority for the program   65228 pm   acuna and that equates obviously to needless dollars and cents being spent in traffic and director i agree with you i mean this is something that should have perhaps been done a few years ago and i know weve had these topics before these discussions it sounds as though were moving closer and closer to that finish line you know having said that i guess my next question is you know just the collection system the information that we acquire i mean as weve stated many many times we are responsible for a very small portion of the diversion equation here i think what is it 50 is actually singlefamily homes that we collect the vast majority belongs with the private sector having said that you know we start the conversation of   65328 pm  franchising now issue its an ugly ugly word to many people but if done and continuing this information can we find something that provides the haulers who choose to participate within the city limits of austin the opportunity to  or actually ask them to participate in providing this information at the end of the day we really dont know what our diversion numbers are accurately we dont how do we get those numbers and again its going to be not the city of austin doing this its going to be the private haulers providing that information and valet services youre absolutely right theyre all over the place now and they are truly in need of providing this information and maybe im speaking out of line for this commission but i think that you would have the support of the commission in doing whatever it takes to expedite efficiencies in a greater service to the   65430 pm  ratepayer especially if its going to lead to reduced cost in the future and more efficient pay scales for the employees thats my two cents guys  appreciate it  acuna any questions commissioners  commission gattuso cathy youre on mute  gattuso yes thank you ms castillo i want to thank you so much for your presentation it was very sensitive i felt like you were really including the commission on that and i appreciate that a lot i also think that  i love the racial equity tool that you all used and it looked like you made extra effort when you didnt get much response from several of the areas and you went back out   65530 pm  there and tried to get more feedback from them and it really showed a difference so thank you for that i saw a lot of really interesting very important things for arr to work on i think the sad part was that some of these things  might take five to ten years and i dont know how much time we have on all this im wondering if in prioritizing are there ways that the commission can be included on that to at least get our feedback on maybe a majority of the commission feels that one thing is more of a priority than another and also one more thing jerry spoke to a lot of things that i thought were very important the other thing is talking about   65632 pm  additional fees for people that  the carts i think thats a must i dont think we can get anywhere without doing that so i hope that wont take five or ten years to accomplish thank you  thank you commissioner for the feedback and yes definitely to clarify on the timeframes that i was sharing we were really trying to find  to start to structure our prioritization so definitely when we talk about a nearterm goal you know being around the fiveyear mark were talking about that timeframe to start so it doesnt necessarily need to start at the fiveyear mark it could start between now and the fiveyear mark so just to kind of clarify and give a little bit more context for that framing for that conversation in terms of including the commissioners on prioritization   65733 pm  moving forward i think thats something that can be considered and can be moved forward as we continue to develop the plan and actually get into the implementation piece because right now we obviously  this is a comprehensive plan so were not talking about implementation yet so once we get to that point of an implementation plan i think that is really when we start looking more closely at what timelines make sense  gattuso thats great and we talked about the word repetitive when talking to the community and i think it would be helpful to be  if staff could be repetitive with us on the commission when there are certain issues that we probably need to hear more about like hows it going or are you all at step one two or three you know we dont work at this all the time and so i would    65834 pm  welcome more feedback on the process thats going on in these different important areas  acuna thank you commissioner  thank you  acuna any other comments or   chair any other comments or questions amanda and then kaiba  thank you for the presentation and the detail that youve provided i had a few questions in relation to the racial equity tool first im curious about the description of the purpose of the tool its specific to external arr initiatives is that because you have a different tool for internal assessment of racial equity  yes great catch yes that is the intent so were wanting to make different tools for different situations and one of those very clear distinctions that were trying to make is external   65935 pm  public facing which would be this one and then internal would be in the future so we havent developed it yet but that is the intent exactly  okay okay thank you and then so when you met with the focus groups and you had a little bit more of a wider ranging discussion were you able to present specifics about this  i guess not specifics about the tool and the second groupings on the timing but were you able to talk with them and get their perceptions on racial equity and environmental justice in relation to arr and the zero waste plan  that conversation did not happen with that focus group no we focused specifically on more along the lines of what could have been in the plan and just overall gauging   70035 pm  where does zero waste stand in terms of prioritization with the community and unfortunately we didnt get to touch on that topic with them  masino i ask partly out of curiosity i cant help but wonder about the research question but also when it comes to implementation buyin getting good participation and programs i am very glad to see the racial equity tool and the fact that arr is going to be using that lens as an evaluator for external programs that is critical and important and i think its a critical to all of you that you are doing that and implementing it i dont know that all stakeholders are going to see that synergy and connection and understand why racial equity is sort of an integral part of how we handle waste and recycling and rate paying so i would be curious going forward if there would be   70137 pm   opportunities to test out that message understand if that could be to engage people who really arent in the conversation and also maybe connect on a different level with people who are in the sustainability conversation but think of the racial equity component as being secondary or tertiary or worse so i just wanted to raise that and id be curious about what that looks like going forward  chair thank you amanda  commissioner  chair go ahead  commissioner masino thank you for that comment i can assure you the racial equity tool will be an integral part of what we do going forward i think the thing to remember here is the development of the plan had been moving forward the team adopted the tool really quickly actually and instead of waiting we decided to start using it immediately so its been a developmental process to pull together all the details associated with   70237 pm  it and also to learn how to use it and then to kind of review how we put into it to make sure that its actually doing what we want right so its been an iterative process but i think going forward now that we have it and were using it you will see the expanded use of it and well able to collect data and have a better understanding of what are your perspectives on this are we meeting your expectations etcetera there will be a number of things that were able to pull from the data once we are able to i guess have time to review the process as we get further along  chair thank you commissioners any other questions amanda kaiba im sorry kaiba youre on mute  white i appreciate the work thats gone into this im curious about indiscernible  chair were having a   70337 pm  difficult time understanding you kaiba  white okay i dont know what to do about that  chair there you go  white all right i am hoping that you could maybe provide a little more detail on what the things that youre considering under tiered uro diversion requirements if you could share a little bit more about what youre considering on that  sure so what we started seeing once we look at the information that we receive from businesses is that theres definitely a wide variety of waste streams and of waste generation and so right now we dont know exactly what type of criteria the pieces that i mentioned in terms of the type of business in terms of the   70438 pm  size of the business those are just potential examples of what we might use to set these different tiers but what we know up to this point is that there is a potential benefit to having different diversion requirements depending on the businesses that were working with but we havent been able to dig fully into all of the data to do a full data analysis in order to get exactly into a this is going to be a tier 1 this is going to be a it tier two this is is going to be a tier three weve just noticed some overarching  trends in the data that we have been able to review  those trends are based on type of business or size  the types of businesses in particular  white so envisioning there would be some more specific requirements for specific types of businesses  yes   70539 pm   white okay i like that and i see a few of these items on here i think most of these probably in some way connect to one of the subcommittees but some of them very clearly do and i dont know is it seems like our subcommittees havent been super active so i was wondering between basically as this draft is being worked out is there an opportunity that we can start having subcommittee meetings to kind of dig into more of the details andrew rivera start looking at what the options can be for these items  absolutely were available to meet your committee and the indiscernible committee i think there is plenty of   70640 pm  material there to discuss  and that was another comment i was going to make later on concerning the subcommittees and how we probably need to get a little bit more active in reviewing some of the options opportunities that are currently existing out there and the challenges because there is numerous challenges that have come to light over the last six months but nonetheless yes as far as the subcommittees absolutely its vital to get together and start to talking and planning about that im sorry kaiba go ahead  white oh no problem i just wanted to say thank you for connecting back to the climate plan i think the austin climate equity plan is obviously a  it should be working in synergy with this and it looks like yall are doing that thats great i am specifically wondering in terms of that per capita   70744 pm  disposal rate what the data might be showing and whats under consideration in terms of a numerical goal  well commissioner the per capita generation rate is typically your total generation divided by the population we dont have all of that data yet were in a process of still working through some of that because weve been until now or as of this plan using the more traditional method which is just a basic subtraction method of your total versus  minus your recycling etcetera were starting a process of trying to evaluate the per capita generation model thats part of this plan and as soon as we have that information or tighter information around what that will look like we will definitely share that with the commission  chair thank you ken  white thank you    70845 pm   chair any other comments questions for selene or the director  im just going to add a little bit to commissioner whites question actually we have been working with a thirdparty for a waste characterization study and as part of that study there is information in order to create a per capita disposal rate so that information should actually be coming to us in the next few months i hear its something we can share  chair thank you gena any other comments guys go for it  i have a question  chair melissa there you go thank you  i have a few followup questions  chair welcome by the way  same topics so regarding the fees to be assessed potentially in the future for contamination my   70946 pm  question is how would that be documented is that a program that the city already has that they log that information and that they would assess that to the customer is that something that would be needed to be purchased in order to put that into practice how would that work logistically  commissioner were not sure yet this would be a brand new item for us to implement the program that im familiar with we had a one dollar fee and you might think one dollar whats that really going to do the point of the one dollar fee was just to get peoples attention right so it wasnt to penalize or hurt people as far as how it would be assessed here and managed here we dont know that yet we would have to figure out what that would look like again this is something that has been proposed as an idea or consideration or something that we could look into to be completely transparent we havent taken a deep dive   71048 pm  into that space rate to figure out the details what the actual number might be and to your point the question about how it would be tracked or implemented and what the vehicle would be for actually making it happen  okay thank you and then another followup question i have is about the transfer station what sort of properties are you looking at are you trying to get just land are you hoping to buy land that already has structures on it are you planning on building those structures  commissioner typically we would at this point take any property we could get its been so difficult to find a property ideally it would be a vacant property that we could just build on and build what we need without having to incur demolition costs as part of the project as well  okay  im sorry  no no go ahead  but ideally we would take any property that we could get at this point that would be suitable we just  we really need a transfer station in our   71148 pm   system and we are definitely dealing with a lot of issues and restrictions because we dont have one in our system right now  sure what size property are you looking for in terms of acreage  minimally i dont have the number off the top of my head that would definitely determine the size of the facility and the types of functions that might take place i would say im thinking in terms of texas size here  ideally  probably minimally you know 20 acres up somewhere in that space because we have to accommodate for the size of the facility parking of containers queuing for traffic on and off of the facility road infrastructure you know maybe slow down lanes ramp lanes for vehicles to speed up and merge safely so theres quite a few considerations that had to be taken into i guess considerations that have to be thought about as we look   71249 pm  for property that would be ideal for a transfer station  chair melissa do you have a real estate license  i dont have a real estate license  chair get one  and then my last question would be about the racial equity tool if somebody could give me an example of what that actually looks like put into practice  sure so the racial equity tool is a little bit difficult to describe just with  without it actually present but basically it starts you off with questions that deal with previous history between the department and the community perhaps where the project or the effort is going to take place then it walks you through steps of how to be communicating with the community with that area what considerations to make and then towards the end were also talking about you know even after   71350 pm  launching the project were also  were circling back were kind of closing that feedback loop with stakeholders so its very community oriented obviously its really a guiding tool if you will for staff in order to be developing programs and services that actually serve the community  okay thank you  chair thank you melissa any other questions kaiba  white its really just a quick comment i just wanted to second what kathie had mentioned about the timeline and i heard the response but i just  yeah i also think anything thats past five years almost doesnt feel real so i hope that near term could become more like one to three years and like longterm is more years thats how im thinking   71452 pm  about things my two cents thank you  chair thank you kaiba you know commissioners again i just want to reiterate every good idea we have every fantastic idea that we envision without the infrastructure in place its just an idea and a dream until you get the infrastructure in place can we  actually make that dream come true and again im referring to a transfer station as a possibility that will open up many many other options for us and looking at the assets that we do currently have we have a beautiful facility over on fm 812 i say beautiful you go over there and it looks like a farmland they did a great job on the cleanup there one of the items in your presentation was the c and d challenges i mean that right there i   71554 pm  can tell you there are no processors certified processors left in central texas having said that is this an opportunity for the city with its facility on fm 812 to get involved with austin energy who actually oversees green building in austin to work together as a partnership into developing a facility that would provide that c and d recycling opportunity or option for the community and again its just a thought i mean have we envisioned that have we started a conversation where we can utilize the tools that we currently have and fm 812 is one of them to achieve your goal  chairman good question recently staff started a process for considering how we might reuse the landfill there and one of the ideas did include some sort of process   71656 pm  of facility so we can certainly take a look and study to see what a viable option or viable model might look like those facilities as you know are really tough theyre   chair extremely tough  theyre definitely needed right and theyre definitely beneficial but i wouldnt want to promise the commission that we can pull it off because theyre really tough and so we can certainly look at it to see what we can come up with or figure out what a serviceable model might look like it might not look like what we would think of as a transitional c and d processing  c and d processing facility it might look somewhat different we might have a different number of items that we could process that way but its certainly something that has been proposed and that weve heard mentioned multiple times in terms of a need for the community and for the system here but theyre just tricky   71757 pm  facilities to run and maintain so well certainly take that into consideration  chair and youre absolutely right ken they are very very tricky very expensive but to your point as you made is it possible to start something with limited opportunities the metals the simple things to do theres other more challenging building materials and there are no answers for today drywall is one gypsum having said that and ill say it again we are requiring c and d recycling and most of our buildings that are currently going up all around us without that support to make it as a goal viable recycling facility to take this material to we really need to do what we want to be    71857 pm  doing here just my two cents guys again selene ken thank you very very much it was a wonderful presentation i look forward to round two and hopefully updates on that and commissioners any other comments for selene thank you guys thank you all right the next item of business is literally the directors report ken dont go too far this is your   thank you chair i dont know if any of the commissioners had any questions about what was in the directors report i know we had some questions from the last meeting and i think we reached out to answer those i dont know if there are any additional questions  chair i had a comment on that really i am glad that were looking at oncall bulk collection i mean that could  literally could be a game changer  absolutely  chair instead of people having to put out their items on a certain   71958 pm  given day and everybody comes by and they end up going through rummaging through making an actual mess in what was a neat pile at one time i think on call is something that is probably going to be well received  and chair you know its actually interesting one of the good things to come out of the pandemic for arr has been the opportunity to just look at how we do business differently to continue to provide services in light of the restrictions that were in place for roughly two years in addition to on call bulk weve also started to schedule at the rrdoc one of the things that we learned from that process is that we can actually get more customers from the facility than we could before we started schedules because of traffic etcetera having people show up at the same time and you have a limited number of people that can get into the facility you have people turning around there were some safety concerns with people   72058 pm  cueing out on to the main roadway so this is just one iteration of one of the things that were doing or some of the things were doing and continuing forward well continue to push the envelope e thank you ken kaiba and then cathy  i guess my question is on the same topic of the bulk collection so im glad that youre expanding it because i think that it really offers the opportunity to indiscernible thank you i know ive been pushing on that i see that currently there are three piles metal and tires are the only things that are separated which i think is the same as the regular collection so im wondering if when you roll that on call collection out at the end of 2023 are you envisioning more   72200 pm   categories being separated im thinking like plastics furniture i saw you were considering some sort of furniture indiscernible anything you can say about that  i dont think were looking at any new categories i think what we hoped to see is that there would be more materials available typically what happens now is is by the time our trucks come through most of the things that were set out are either gone or is just trash left behind so i dont know that were looking at any new categories im not sure exactly what you mean by plastic if you mean larger plastic furniture items and things like that  yeah everything  i think we would just collect those things is what we would do as part of the collection process  chair thank you  white i guess im wondering why would you not consider converting those into recycling  the plastic items the   72302 pm  plastic furniture  yes im just thinking when you go to the dropbox center theres a place for bulky hard plastics can they be picked up and diverted  we havent but we can consider that well make a note of it and add it to the things that we look at as part of this new process  thank you  chair cathy did you have a question  yes when youre looking at the on call service quantity is going to be important are people going to have to tell you what they have and are you going to just go pick up two or three items or what are you looking at when you do on call  well it certainly helps to know what they have we kind of take the calls and then decide how to create a route so that were not crisscrossing the city and so were still kind of working out some of the details on that   72404 pm  as far as how we determine what they have thats part of the process but we wouldnt want to stop someone from setting out something that they may have forgotten about or say well were not going to take that we probably would just collect anything that they set out at that point if they schedule themselves for a collection  chair thank you ken kathie is that   well it seems like a lot of wasted fuel if theyre just going to put out a few things  youre concerned about the quantity of things that they set out  yes  okay so thats why we would build a route so for example if four or five people called from the same neighborhood we would  when we build the route we would focus on that given area as opposed to if we have four or five calls from four corners of the city we wouldnt chase those around wed wait until we could build an appropriate route to be able to service those areas  okay so you might tell the   72507 pm   customer that you would get back with them as soon as you build a route around them  yes correct  all right thank you  chair amanda  masino yeah i had a question about the solicitations like the upcoming solicitations the household hazardous waste and mattress recycling program have been in this  under development phase for quite awhile so im curious about whats going on with those  the mattresses i think i can speak to pretty quickly we have donald on board here he can speak to it probably more eloquently than i can i can tell you ive had quite a bit of experience of trying to stand up and establish mattress collection or mattress processing facility and its one of the areas   72608 pm  that most entities struggle with and even prior to me arriving here in austin theyve tried it several times and its really difficult prior to coming here i was part of a program that tried it five times and entities stand up they try it and what would typically happen is they would give it a shot and then they couldnt make it work so mattresses are a really tough item to make work the reason that one is dragging on is because were still trying and constantly working to try to get a company to agree to try a pilot or to try to process the mattresses so donald do you want to speak to those two items  sure sure donald hardy austin resource recovery as far as the mattresses go there is a scope of work thats being worked on and were hoping to have that out for a pilot in the very near future its actually  most of the scope is complete actually as we speak  chair thank you don   72708 pm   and the other item thats an ila with travis county thats being worked on its a little bit of a delay i think travis county may have had some turnover as well but the folks we were working with over there once again working on those things hope to have some answers soon  are you thinking within the next couple of months probably were going to see  i hope so i hope so especially the mattresses that seems like its been a very long time coming  okay thank you for the update  chair and yes we have tried it before and it is extremely challenging the recycling of mattresses for some strange reason nobody wants to sleep on your old mattress anyway guys any other comments kaiba  white on that hazardous waste is that just outside of city limits because yall are already doing it for estimate city limits or    72809 pm  inside city limits  thats going to be for the travis county customers that are using the facility so that travis county would be responsible for the material thats brought in  everyone will be able to have these items disposed of  yeah our facility would still be available for everyone yes  okay so its not about picking up from households  no its for travis county folks indiscernible  chair  dropoff  thank you  chair and my last comment on that public or private service provider on the on call bulk is that us or is that going to be private hauler or contracted hauler  right now its scheduled to be us weve been using the private hauler during the gap in the   72910 pm  interim but the plan is the city would take on that work  chair thank you ken any other comments on the directors report guys thank you very much good job all right lets see moving on guys i think we actually have gotten to a thing called future agenda items and ive got a couple of silly  i would love for us to continue the conversation on i guess the  guys help me here probably a victoria question what would a 22dollar an hour minimum wage do to arrs budget future budget and are we prepped for that can we look at that in the future talk about that as an item on how to prepare for a 22dollar wage for our employees  chairman im happy you   73010 pm  asked that question yes weve already looked into it and were ready for it right yeah i think that its definitely warranted it would help us be competitive in the market as we compete for cdl holders and compete to keep our own so we definitely need to be there somewhere in that space around that 22dollar an hour mark and weve been doing the homework and were ready  chair thank you ken commissioners any future items you want to see i would love  ken i would love to add the continued publicprivate hauler franchise discussion if we can start that conversation because it kind of leads into a lot of what youre planning to do in the future and the sooner that we begin those conversations hopefully the quicker we can come up with some solutions and the other thing im looking at here is the transfer station again that babys not going to go   73110 pm  away in fact its probably going to get a little bit more needed to say the least so we can look at that at least come up with some ideas and thoughts on where we are today and how we get to the next step and again back to that franchise thing i think once we get everybody on board all the haulers on board doing the same thing i think it will make life a heck of a lot easier for arr and the city of austin working together but those are my thoughts my items future items cathy  yes were having a uro committee meeting on june 30th id like to speak at the next meeting about what we covered  chair thank you   73212 pm   cathy be careful what you ask for any other items guys hearing no other items commissioners i will entertain a motion for adjournment believe it or not  move adjournment  chair i hear a motion kaiba second by commissioner gattuso hearing no discussion because i turned off my mic but anyway all those in favor raise your hands done thank you thank you by the way it gets clone lonely up here guys right i welcome you to come back and join us all right anyway commissioners thank you very very much for everything have a great rest of the month   112955 pm  awesome with that then i think we can we can get going 80 extent if you already hello everyone my name is nehemiah pitts the third im calling to order the regularly scheduled meeting of the community technology and telecommunications commission thank you for joining us well begin with the roll call alaska everyone in the room ah from left to right my left to right to go ahead and introduce themselves and the district that they were appointed to represent beginning with our far left here and our brand new commissioner hi this is commissioner christina garza representing district four malcolm yates representing district three as i mentioned nehemiah pitts the third and im representing district one dave floyd   113056 pm  district five and then going to online beginning with the vice chair even apodaca representing district two and now for commissioner dasgupta im just gonna go in the order the screen i see here the task of representing district 10 and commissioner island maxine island representing district seven great thank you so much without them will proceed in our agenda the first item up is public communication general and we have ah the wonderful advantage of having a citizen sign up so with that then it is my pleasure to announce ms rosenthal if you could please state your full name and introduce yourself sure you might check were good here   113156 pm  just fine thank you thank you  hi thank you chair pitts and commissioners my name is courtney rosenthal my pronouns are she her hers so you know im a former member of this commission i served for 12 years up to 2014 currently im on the library commission although my presence tonight is unrelated to that i wish to let you know that there is an opportunity ahead that could benefit from your involvement this relates to two reports being prepared by city staff concerning cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology back in march the city council adopted two resolutions that direct city staff to  prepare reports on these matters there was a lot of public interest at the time they generated significant media coverage both national and local one k xc and news story framed it as austin considering whether it would become a quote   113257 pm  crypto city and quote now that the reports are coming do i think there should be an opportunity for the community to receive the information thats in them unfortunately there is no public presentation plan they just would be issued as memos to counsel given the interest and the potential impact of these issues i think there should be some public visibility into these reports therefore i respectfully proposed that you request the briefing from city staff on these reports and their findings i think this commission is especially well suited to receive this briefing  youre used to evaluating new technologies and how they may benefit our residents moreover you are especially adept add evaluating these through an equity lens one reason im concerned is because should austin choose to accept payments in the form of cryptocurrency   113358 pm  it will send a message to residents that its okay to go all in on crypto as somebody who bought a small amount of crypto back in march and watch my portfolio shed about 40 in value i believe that would be harmful another key point is that the blockchain resolution calls for exploring other technologies unrelated to blockchain that may serve the public good such as public banking i look forward to how the report addresses these opportunities a public presentation of these two reports would serve the community and would benefit from your consideration thats why i hope youll request a briefing from staff on these reports thank you very much thank you wonderful thank you so much for that munich action and information share id like to give a chance for commissioners   113504 pm  to ask any questions they might have in a brief timeframe but before i do id like to see this opportunity but ah express my thoughts i concur with your sentiment ah and although i anticipate there will be broad support for a briefing amongst this commission ah its something that i will advocate for personally i have also been curious about the applications for blockchain with ah solutions for people experiencing homelessness ah as it comes to document management capabilities and other things so i think there is promise indeed and at the same time having had lots of friends who experienced similar dynamics related to crypto ah theres also natural pause with crypto and what that could mean and mass so those are my thoughts i would like to give everyone    113605 pm  else a chance jesse point of order here can we discuss anything that is presented during citizen communication we can have basic q and a but if were going to have a full discussion within the commission i would suggest that we posted as an agenda item on the next meeting okay well thank you for bringing this to our attention i definitely think that this commission needs to look into this so thats my thoughts on that like please yes thank you again for bringing the store attention i agree i think we do need to request this report appreciate it i mean like i concur thanks for the same same thing i was saying but thanks for bringing to our attention that definitely needs to be discussed by us with the city and i open discussion where we can ask a lot of questions   113706 pm  and get more information out for the public to digest and for commissions online and see commission dasgupta raising his hand yeah i want to agree with everything thats been said so far thank you very much for bringing to our attention ive had some exposure to this to my council member but i think this commission definitely needs to dig deeper into it and the other commissioners online would like to weigh in feel free i definitely agree i think this is a very important topics that needs to have some visibility from the commission yeah i i would concur not sure i have anything else to add other than look forward to discussing this more deeply into future commission meeting thank you for that feedback commissioners and thank you again for your time miss rosenthal really appreciate it as well as your service to the library commission and this commission in the past with that then   113809 pm  will proceed in our agenda now changing the item one approval of the minutes from the april 13th ah and excuse me april 13th 2022 may 11th 2022 meeting ah as ah the record reflects we did not have a sufficient vote to approve the minutes based upon abstentions and those who werent in attendance and have a chance at that point to review the minutes so hopefully at this point we do have that ah so i look forward to a motion to approve these minutes as presented unless their edits and then a second chair pitts yeah i have a minor headed here the current commission member for district for or council member rather is identified as greg k star i believe that council member of bella was sworn in at that point okay thats a good catch   113912 pm   and to be clear we have okay well i think we have an interesting dynamic im not sure if the documents that you have online are the same but based on what i have in my folder we may have to table this vote again because i have well i just makes other changes so okay for the minutes that i have dated for the meeting april 13th i do list former council member greg cassar however for the ones listed mistakenly for april 13th which is an edit that i would request that we amend this date to reflect the date of that meeting which is actually may the 11th that does actually reflect the correct appointment from council member vela so i think we just need to   114013 pm  make an edit of the date but i want to stand i want to give jesse a chance to confirm that yes i wanted to happen real quick i told this to commissioner yeatts i didnt have a chance to tell everybody else but i did catch that date error in after printing i just didnt want to reprint all of the documents so the date is correct on the digital version okay okay so then commissioner vice chair on that version that youre looking at data for may the 11th are you are you stating that at that point that that documents incorrect although it should show counselor vela and that the at the point of the april 13th minutes that that thats what we need to mend i just want to make sure that i understand your concern yeah apologies its the april 13 minutes okay   114117 pm  and i appreciate that clarification ah i have to admit im unable to level set that based upon my remembrance of the calendar but i will certainly take that ah we just have to look for someone else to be able to confirm that in order to get a second i can confirm that council member vela was sworn in on january 25th so happy to make that amendment okay great great so then i will go ahead and second the motion and with that thing we can hold well unless there any other changes we can go ahead and hold the boat to amend the minutes as presented with in person with the correct date to match the one thats presented to our commissioners online and also to reflect the election of council member villa effective january 25th when they were sworn in all in favor of that amendment to these minutes please say aye and show your hands hi anyone opposed and   114221 pm  anyone abstaining i am upsetting since i was not here for either of those meetings fair enough so with that then we have a vote to approve these minutes with one abstention ah six in the affirmative and 1 1 abstention hmm and to clarify that were boat was for both sets of minutes as was reflected in this agenda item right approval of the minutes from both dates so with that we proceed in our agenda to agenda item to a staff and community briefings beginning with the united way presentation on  connect 80 x us with that id like to welcome our speakers delighted to have you join us annabella toronto   114322 pm  and francisco gay goes thank you for joining us can you all hear me okay make sure we can hear you there might be a little goldilocks still and play maybe just a tad louder but okay okay i can definitely do that right thank you claire thank you very much okay perfect yeah can i go ahead and share my screen as well yes we are transferring ah to you momentarily okay perfect  yeah everyone good afternoon  my name is anna bella i am part of the united way specifically with the connect 80 x team here just to give a presentation about connecting tx its online features and   114426 pm  its not online features and all of the functions and capabilities that it currently has alongside with me is also francisco diegos who is also part of united way and ill let him introduce himself actually thank you anabella happy to be here too present on this i think very productive platform my name is francisco diegos and im a program manager of the united way and i oversee digital inclusion initiatives within the organization inability should be able to share your screen now okay its still blacked out for me we are diagnosing over here   114527 pm  give us one moment okay i can i can go ahead and start i dont really i think the visuals are more so for your sake so youre not only having to listen to my voice but i can definitely just go ahead and get started so yeah like i said my name is anna bella as part of the connected tx team my role is to really connect with community based organizations in the utilization of the platform and really support their needs and whatever way that makes sense for them as part of this work i like to see that connect the t x is really what we like to do is were connectors connectors of community resources and whatever makes sense moving forward there are a couple of i guess for kind of different areas within connect 80 x one is that it is an online community tool and then again connects those peoples program services that are free or reduced cost to the community moving forward and thats kind   114630 pm   of the on line component and what ill spend the bulk of today kind of demonstrating and talking to you all about and i think i can i see that i can share my stream now so let me go ahead and do that alright can get to see my screen okay perfect so like i was mentioning connect 80 x it is part of our community tool that ill send the bulk of today and then part the online im sorry the helpline that we also have available so this is really an opportunity for those that either dont have online accessibility or really just prefer to talk to someone in person to be able to chat to someone live theres helpline is available via phone text and   114733 pm  chat with bilingual staff and we also have a language plane available whats really great is that all that what we call them navigators are frontline stuff is that just help line something that we learned is that especially during with this storm is that a lot of people like texting right being able to be connected to those resources texting is one of those ways so that is something that we have also recently launched within the past few months and have really been utilizing a lot and then additionally apart open it gtx is what really people like is the what we call the closing referral system so this allows organizations to directly received referrals basic information about someone directly from the community through the online set and ultimately really its just so great way for organizations to network amusing and over variety of ways that ill demonstrate today to really help and serve those in need so in terms of   114834 pm  the online features is one of being able to have any programs listed on the the site itself even site is listed organizations also have the opportunity to what we call claiming which means taking ownership of that listing and being able to update eight up has a listing updated in real time especially during covid there is a lot of changes going on all the time we know that sometimes hours change locations  change opportunities like that  so organizations then can really say we can update this information real time moving forward since we have ownership of this program listing anyone within the community can really search for resources and refer clients to other programs online resources and ill show you again what kind of those searching capabilities are and how do you liza platform to its best abilities the third one that i like to very very loosely loosely uses what we   114936 pm  call a case management system and id like to say very loosely because it will never truly replace an entire system all that really does if youre still you know on panta paper or still using spreadsheets this is a nice upgrade in that youre able to manage client profiles youre able to see the individual information youre able to attach goals and youre able to see all of their referrals that were sent over  and sent in in one systemized location and then additionally  being able to actively respond update referral status is this is what we mean when were saying this closed loop system idea that not only are you able to send and receive referrals but youre also able to follow the trajectory of that individual so youre able to say this person got help maybe they didnt receive help they were referred elsewhere really being able to make sure that the individual actually got the help that they were wanting to receive and then the fourth function is that we know that data and analytics are super   115037 pm  important so making sure that also on the back end they have the capability to view all of this information theyre able to view kind of in real time the impact that theyre having on their community so what is connected tx it is an online data tool today connecting tx is completely free and available to anyone it can be done anonymously or by creating a free account theres absolutely no charge nothing on our end as a part of connecting tx we do have some what we call network partners and either just organizations who have committed to not only being on the system and updating it but really committed to updating the status is on a regular bases and so those partners youll see kind of listed higher up the search result list but also youll be able to see they have theyll have like a connect et ex partner tag next to their name and then on the screen i   115138 pm  alluded to the helpline i wanted to make sure that that information is also visited so we have the phone number listed on here again thats monday through friday eight am to six pm or they can also get available to those that help i m b a text on that zip code to eat 5511 something to note with our helpline is that it is not anonymous it is something what we really strive to do is to make sure again that were following the trajectory of that individual and so usually when somebody calls in or the text in  what we do is go through a an assessment with the individual we want to make sure that were meeting all of their needs and so we asked them questions like what is your type party what are you hoping to accomplish and then within a couple of days follow up with them as well like did you get your services the individual that we connected you with where you able to receive help if not heres another resource you can also appoint you to so again really all about not only connecting but following their   115239 pm  journey so the first thing that i will talk about is e the searching and kind of all the features associated that when anyone is searching on connected t s it is completely free or reduced costs that is something that we actively strive for and we have a whole day of these team committed to this  searching can be done completely anonymous again or you can be logged in and create a profile creating a profile really allows you the opportunity to save and view the history of anyone that is either youre referring out or youre receiving information from because connected t x is powered by this larger network called find help it is always when we start our searching process we start by the zip code and then especially here in austin as we think about the central texas region we want to make sure that were searching by the closest available resource to that individual on connecting tax theres also   115340 pm  language features so we know that there is more more than one language there are multiple languages that are here in our central austin region and so being able to utilize that moving forward is something that we want to make sure is available and ill definitely demonstrate kind of a couple of those options and then also we know that every individual has a unique need every person is individualized to what they again what they need and so were able to kind of narrow in our search results using filter options we can filter by age we can filter by income and ill be able to show you all exactly what that looks like as well and then the fourth thing when were searching is also being able to utilize saved so if youre someone that really engages with the platform really regularly and you know an organization that is trusted and reliable you can go ahead and save that organization to your profile you can send multiple resources we call a research shopping cart to an individual   115441 pm   and you go to share their search results so you can send it through the platform or you can share it in a multitude of ways so with that were gonna go ahead and talk a little bit about understanding the program card so when were searching on connected t x anytime there is this white box that you see on here this is what we call a program card this is a resource  that is listed on connected t x and you can see on here as a very top is going to be the name of the program and at the bottom right below its going to be the name of the organization on here youre also going to have a really brief description of the program that that organization what kind of the services that they provide the main services this is really helpful when doing the searching process youll see sometimes multiple tags listed on here and then also the population that theyre serving so if there is a specific population   115542 pm  that an organization serves they can definitely filter through that as well and then at the top right here we see a checkmark so that check mark what essentially what that means is that an organization has logged in and has claimed that program card means to have ownership theyre aware that there  program is listed on connected t x and theyre actively using it and so you you always see this checkmark at the very top right at the very right in the middle here we see a next steps so information about the organization their preferred contact information their email but super super importantly and what ill talk about a little bit later is this green the screen button that we have listed on here essentially what this green button means is this is the way the organization prefers to be contacted and this is also the best way if youll know if an organization has a referral to and is accepting referrals through the platform itself and   115647 pm  then infused girl a little bit to the left here this is just a picture of it but well go into the demonstration in just a second youre able if i click on here im able to see more information and this is all the four different buttons so i can save this program card if i know i utilize it really frequently i can share this information to a client a variety of ways i can also take internal notes so when i talked about that case management piece if i wanted to if i know lets say i know that i regularly see connected tx two demonstration program and i know that francisco its a great point of contact i can write in that note for myself to make sure that i remember to contact francisco and then here lets say a i have a i see that the hours maybe are not aligned and i call and they say actually you know what our hours are from 8 to 4 pm i can go ahead and suggest to have that updated so the rest of the community is also aware so that was just a   115750 pm  brief overview im gonna go into the demonstration now of connected tax live so that you all can see everything that we talked about so when we go to connect 80 x this is all always what im going to see i can see at the very top its help starts here and then im always gonna start by zip code but because were doing a training for today what i want to point out instead as i want to scroll all the way to the bottom because i really want to highlight this translate this speech function this is powered by google translate this right here this page you can see theres only a limited amount of languages and again this is just for this page this is not for all of us searching functions if i scroll a little bit up i can also see all the training opportunities that are available within connect the t x and these are alive and so if you are we have those   115851 pm  periodically if youre wanting more or if you want someone else to also partake in some of these trainings theyre also constantly available either live or you can watch a pre recorded session on here you want to tell someone hey i got this great training on 90 tx this is where you would you can direct  them to for more information ill so if you want to get a hold of us and this is the best you know to be able to reach us as the info at gtx org youre probably get connected to me since ive worked with media based organizations on a regular learn about how to become a partner updating resource cards or really any sort of general information that you are needing something else that i wanted to highlight within connect the t x is our lift partnership so we do have a partnership with lift and anyone can get free rides for any basic needs and we need any basically they can get access to food employment healthcare   115951 pm  school vaccine really literally anything to get access to that lived partnership  and they will be able to call the hotline or the helpline that i talked about earlier and to be able to get access to that and then again at the very top if i scroll up a little bit further its the need help so if i forget i dont remember the presentation that she gave me where do i find that information where do i find that phone number this is where you can find that information so here is the way to call chat with a team member or texas in code so everything is on this first club page in case we forget and then also on the very right if i go through this presentation and i really like it and i want to create a profile to log in or sign up this is also where im able to find that so with that im going to scroll all the way back up to be able to really start searching and utilizing connect 80 x i wouldnt be using   120054 am  franciscos name a lot throughout the demonstration just as he is my test person for today so im going to be pretending that im navigating francisco through this san francisco let me know that his preferred zip code is 78724 so im gonna click on search and then when i do that im redirected to this page theres a couple of ways that i can help francisco out one is by category and subcategory so if i go to the top i can see theres multiple items on here so theres food and then when i scroll over food i can also see the subcategories associated with it second seafood food pantries snap and wic etcetera  and this will be the case for every single category that i hover over and you can see that we have quite a few categories listed on here so that is one way to begin the searching process the other way is just to be able to directly type it in so if i know directly that   120154 am  president chacon needs help with finding diapers i can click and diapers and that is a tag that is listed on here and i can click on that directly as well i can also while im here change the language so here you can see all of the language features that are available and again this is listed and empowered via google translate so its not always 100 i will say that but this is definitely a more comprehensive list of  all the languages are available and then lastly if i ever while im in the searching process want to change the zip code i can also do that at the very top in this search bar alright so now im going to say so francisco and i are talking and he lets me know he really needs support and finding a food pantry so at the very top im going to click on food and then   120255 am  click on food pantries and im here im going to highlight a couple of things that are available so first thing that i always highlight is this matte feature again this is really important especially here in austin if i expand that out a little bit bigger you can see all of the food pantry office options within his area this is also really helpful like lets say francisco works up north but he lives down south what is his preferred area does he prefer to look at food pantries up north down south somewhere in between that is on his route on his way phone really being able to utilize the that feature for this so if i exit out of this then i can also see what i alluded to earlier which was this program card again each program card is an individual resource that is listed on connect the t x at the very top  i can see that is the name of   120355 am  the program in this case is going to be fresh food families it is by the central texas food bank and i also see that they are connected t ex partner so i know that they are actively accepting ferral through the platform which means that i can send over basic information come to them as well and there regularly updating and being able to see the status is of all this and then i also see a brief description i can see the main services which is the food pantry and i can also see the population that theyre serving  so this one says all ages covid19 familys income and limited english if im like im still not really sure if this is the right fit i can also click on more information click on more information i can see the eligibility requirements if theyre available and sometimes organizations view there will have like look capacity or theyll have limited funds and so youre able to see the different updates on here and then i can face see a full description of this exact   120457 am  program card the central texas food bank has decided to have their entire schedule listed on here but every single program depending on the organization will have this view a little bit differently i can also view the languages that are on here the cost of the program i can see its free which is really great and then all the different coverage areas and then also on here by scroll a little bit further down i can see that the mirrors location is the greater love baptist church  and if i scroll a little bit further down i can start seeing the other areas as well within that location and then on here so i really wanted to ask  francisco like how would you like this information to be received so one he just let me know you know what i just wanted to be printed and i will do the rest on my own which is completely fine we can do a print view and you know right there in the office give it to him the other options that we   120558 am  have on here and were telling someone in about this program is to be able to send an email because im logged in you can see my email address is already listed but i can send this email to francisco and letting him know hey this is a really great program and really importantly i can also change the language of the email so if i know that he has a different preferred language i can scroll through and look through and that email will be sent in his preferred one way i could also send this via text if i wanted to so again my name is listed on here i can ask for a franciscos phone number and then the text message of that language that hes going to be receiving and then for if whatever reason you will have an awareness of his their facebook you can also share it with your facebook okay and then what i also wanted to highlight on here is this green button so this green button is   120700 am  what we call the referral tool at all yeah let me i want to go through this so if i click on this referral tool i see that its called a basic so one step and essentially this means  that i can refer i know in this case im referring someone else i can also type in their name on here i feel like ive you havent used francisco as a demonstration but ive used other coworkers so lets say marcela ramirez i type in their information and their preferred language and then she let me know you know the best way to reach me is actually the text message and whats great is that an impromptu me to provide a phone number on here i can also add a comment if i so choose so lets say that they informed me that theyre working between the hours of noon to five and they prefer to be contacted in the morning so i can write a note to the agency to central texas food bank and let them know hey marcela would   120801 am  be hurt prefer to be contacted between the hours of 9 to 11 am and then super importantly  is confirming consent so i want to make sure that i have the appropriate consent from marcela to be able to send their information over to the central texas food bank so that is the program card itself and i can also narrow down the search further because right now i see there are 80 results but if i want to do this i can also vote blue five personal filters you can see theres a ton of options to be able to do that i can see low income i can see if they have families with children citizenship veteran status etcetera i can also filter based on the program itself so lets say francisco has let me know you know what i really prefer i want to visit the location and so then it prompts me to be able like to narrow    120901 am  that down a little bit further i also know that fancy school works weekends so i want to make sure that theyre open now and theyre open and i want to make sure i know that francisco also has the kids so make sure its available during school and then being able to select but the language of the program communication and then the third option on here is an income eligibility so income eligibility just helps you narrow in on that searching process a little bit further i will say this is our least commonly used a feature on here just because a lot of this is already free or reduced cost so i feel like ive been talking a lot and that is just a basic searching and how to utilize the connected tx platform part two is going into the more detailed features of what it means to   121002 am  turn on referral tools and all those capabilities but i didnt want to pause here and see if there are any questions thank you anabella we really appreciate that and the presentation so far ah i know ive got a couple questions myself and others might as well and or at least opportunities to drill down a little bit one of the things i wanted to ask about is pertaining to the ways which partners are added partners programs and resources  it seemed as though when you focus on the website that might have been really an opportunity to kind of jump in on that but i wanted to wait i didnt wanna interrupt you would you mind focusing on that piece again yeah so youre talking about this connect 80 ex partner tag like how organizations get added that functionality yes maam yes annabella thank you awesome yeah so with that they have to commit to one turning on the referral tool most on here   121104 am  you can see that have been a d tx partner have a role to which means that theyre accepting referrals directly through the platform they dont have that you can sometimes you can see like a c next steps so if i click on that itll just direct me to the programs website instead so that is one of them  the second one is to update the status is of the referral within a timely kind of manner so internally we want to make sure that if were actually following the client that its within at least like a two week return that theyre following up with that individual and then the third one is really having what we call workflow documentation in place so knowing who is going to be updating it knowing who is going to be responding to the referrals whos gonna be responding to the referrals whether thats like the birth theyre calling the individual or texting the individuals seeking services or theyre updating the status of it so we    121205 am  go with them i go through a whole kind of process kind of a lengthy probably about a month or so process and yeah those are the three main ways great thank you for that and my last question before i pass it on to my peers is ah its actually pertaining to a slide that she didnt really focus on in your presentation today so i dont want id like to level set there was a slide that we had included ah that i guess would have been the third slide that referred to 211 texas yeah id like to just speak to that briefly and then to give you an opportunity to share ah any collaboration that has taken place ah or ah thoughts about collaboration with austin 311 particularly with their new smart ap yeah good question so   121310 am  i just originally had taken it out just for the sake of time but im happy to go into the history of that just really briefly so as we know 211 is a state funded agency at the very beginning the idea was that to be able to instead of having a 211 and connected to help find the way that it is now being able to utilize to and once i really both through those assessments but then covid happened and the way that you won one that was utilized got dramatically changed so currently to 11 or previously to 11 used to be able you would call in and you would get sent to your nearest person to the nearest like within years of code now its the nearest to the next available kind of online person so i can talk to some if i call 211 theres a potential that i could talk to someone who is currently lets say or in houston so when that happened and then we kind of had to change gears a little bit   121411 am   but what i wanted to bring up is that we see that t 11 and connect gtx are very complementary to each other 211 is really focused on those basic needs if you need immediate help right away there 24 hours then you go ahead and we say yes go ahead and call to one woman versus connect the t x its more about that like holistic journey its more about like were taking time were taking 15 20 minutes to be able to do with your full assessment beyond just basic needs to be able to identify other resources and then also following them and seeing what happened to that individual i think the main two differences thank you for that i guess one thing i do want to make sure to interject before i passed it off again and give you a chance to respond is to clarify i was referring to the city of austins 311 311 smart app and curious about any plans   121511 am   to interact or integrate there its very different but i wont say very its different primarily in that ah it is meant to be a way for citizens to also input service requests and things of that nature you know overgrown grass you know graffiti removal things like this however it has great potential as well for ah resource distribution access to a variety of programs and resources that could share space with connected 80 x so naturally advise the question about any type of integrations that might be possible or that have been conceived of today yeah okay okay good question yeah connect connect 80 x is focused on those like social services moving forward and so currently i am thats might be above my pay grade but im not aware of anything that doesnt   121612 am  mean its not happening that just means im not aware of it but thats something i can definitely like check in awesome thank you for that with that then id like to open it up to anyone else to asking questions or finding feedback i see commission yates and then commissioner yeah well at your pitts i think your your question was the same as mine and that was if a citizen calls 311 would they be able to be connected to this service i if they call to me 11 now i know what you want one they will be with 311 because its different in terms of the type of service i dont believe so unless they have an awareness of right well maybe 31311   121712 am  operator would refer them to the 211 service and then the 211 service possibly might connect to you right yeah thats currently how we operate is like 211 refers to connect 80 x thanks commissioner garza thank you for the presentation annabella how long has the site been live good question so it is not been life for long the version that you see here today has only been existence i would say about a year or so 90 tx officially officially launched at the peak of covid in march of 2020 and then obviously everything happened and it looked slightly different so its about i would say two years old how would someone find this resource because i just googled pre diapers in austin or basic needs in austin and it wouldnt come within the first four pages of google so how would someone know that this   121813 am  resource exists yeah so in terms of like our current outreach plan we try our best to really table as in as many events have to as many organizations have as many presentations as we as we are here today i will say that it is currently word of mouth as much as we do have a partnership with a i s d for example were have partnerships with a couple of clinics and so slowly but surely you know were getting out there and getting in front of individuals but that doesnt mean that we cant do more i will say and i think also because its just so new that when you do like a basic global search is definitely not going to  be the first thing that populates and because its such a generalized resource if i unless i know specifically type in the keywords for like general services versus like a diaper i can definitely see connect gtx not the very beginning thank   121915 am  you since youve been using this the sideline for like two years a year do you know right now what who is your user whos actually using this service yeah most of them are actually organizations that utilize the platform i think that was the first targeted outreach plan organizations especially because we wanted to have them being able to turn on the referral tool and then with the hope that eventually as we are able to build up the platform than more and more individuals are utilizing it thank you and then my last question and then ill let other people speak how to residents were undocumented interact with this up in terms of he said that you collect information if they call the hotline what information is there to understand what is safe for them and not maybe not so safe for them to to reach out to yeah good question so right   122017 am  now im currently logged in but i dont have to be logged in i can sign out and start this like searching process completely anonymously and then i fail also go back to your personal filters and i clicked on undocumented yeah its been hot its been glitchy lately for me its only been for me so i think its my computer but if i im sorry i went back really fast click on a personal filters and i click on undocumented and filter research  and then itll populate specific resources for those undocumented folks and then went on here i can then see exactly like if i if its fresh food for families then im able to utilize and go directly however i feel safe and comfortable doing so moving forward this is the platform itself is compliant and so like i have no even though im like a user of the platform itself i dont have any visibility of like individual people the only   122119 am  people that i can see is anyone that contact us directly okay thank you yeah so they can either if they feel comfortable they can refer themselves or they can just go to more information and see how to best get contacted i would like to supplement the response the first one that annabella provided many members of the connect 80 also connect 80 x team also partaken coalition activities so theyre very much in the waves are broad infrastructure and our engagement with multitude organizations here in austin and theres often a referral to this specific platform to co locate services and allow them to utilize this as a standard case management tool already expressed thank you francisco and i do  know you i will disclose my organization is listed on this website and were part of all the united white coalition so this was   122220 am  just a really good opportunity for me to dig deeper so thank you thank you for that i thank you for those questions i guess ill give you a chance to let us know what organization youre referring to i wanted austin which is not listed as a partner of connecting tx even though were one of the founding partners of all of your coalitions but so thats also im glad that you asked that question because that was going to be one of mine we do refer are this has been a useful website for our home visitors for home educators because it does have its a nice summary of a lot of the community services we have not gotten any referrals from this website to us we have used it to get referrals so usually like there wouldnt be anyone in this community that would know about a fancy austin through this height and not through like our website or facebook page or word about but it is helpful for our home visitors or parent educators and early childhood educators to have a list of all these services great thank   122322 am  you for that another therell be an opportunity to dive in a little deeper in our working group discussion but appreciate that that share here now and i know that were also midway so i wanted to level set from a timing standpoint or were however way but i think we still have a portion talk to still complete is that correct yeah and i will say i did thats a good reminder too that i did give a presentation into urban like a couple of training sessions completely in spanish to the home workers so i know that i worked a lot i think with the i can remember her title by i worked a lot with maggie and i think her and i are still working on updating that connected tx partner having as well usually the connected to ex partner tag the higher or when you have it then the more likely you are to populate higher on the list thank you okay and just to clarify i was trying to confirm how much more time you needed for the presentation today yeah i would say probably like just another i know that pretty   122427 am  close to time like 15 minutes at the most with questions okay ah well well give you a chance well i guess before we proceed if i can get a visual on our online commissioners or give them a chance to win with anything they might have before we proceed questions at this point i had a question in regards to the website do you have any type of metrics or statistics in the past couple of years on what zip codes are getting the most searches is were what types of filters or programs are getting the most traction i do and if i i can go into that my program tools and their program analytics and  its just a  thats a lot of data at the current moment i will say just from the last time that i saw food is always the highest most search trends within connect 80 x and i cant remember having several memory   122528 am  but i cant remember the top searches approach right now but there is there is capability and ability to be able to be with that might be a good opportunity for us to also take a look at that data and figure out if we need to address certain inequities in different areas of town the other question i had was when there are areas or things that are happening in the state of the world like say the baby food or formula shortage are there anything special that is done on the website to help users find that type of resource yeah good question the only thing that weve really done is to make sure that were up to date on all other programs that currently have it or database team are the ones that are really utilizing every single day and updating the program listings thats as much as i think within this within specifically connected tx i   122629 am  will stay within the larger united way and theres coalitions and things that were a part of but specifically for this platform its just about making sure that that information is up to date when people are trying to search that might be another area where when there are big things like that to maybe promoted it or create a separate category just for that to help people easily find that information because i for example just tried to type in baby formula and nothing showed up so if i was looking specifically for that i wouldnt be able to find any resource to help me so yeah but thank you this was really really great yeah of course i want to add that we do have a report as well the community needs and trends report that aggregates some of this information available as well thank you for that and thank you for that question commissioner alan ah our online commissioners and other questions before proceed here you know there are two of us   122729 am  here yes commission dasgupta please go right ahead good so other several questions i thought i saw in one of your slides it says weekdays only is that true i mean its weakness only er yeah good question so thats where helpline for the connected tx help blind specifically thats only monday through friday nine am to six am im sorry to six pm be able to search that can be done at any time given day its just more so to be connected specifically to our navigators so do you have any plans to extend it to seven days service 24 7 because particularly im thinking up the demographics of people moving into this town right a lot of young people very tech savvy people moving in but guess what following them theres a large number of retirees moving in following their children mm hmm  three couples who wont be here because their kids moved here okay and they are not necessarily that takes seven so it really is 22 questions   122830 am  actually to spare statements one is shepherds asked about 311 the more you unify this into a complete you know template complete you know that theyre theyre canvas of services where one connects to the other where they dont have to die three different numbers to get to this source that would be of immense value because i know elderly people who are lost in the tech world and if theyre moving into town they need help immediately sometimes like they lost their their medications etcetera so the more you know you go to 24 7 service the better off and also connections to other similar services yeah i will also say anytime like can i pay taxes definitely not for immediate needs anything for immediate need we always refer to 211 connected because we will be on the phone with connected tax for really part of a lengthy amount of time i always recommend but yeah youre right i think   122931 am  that i totally hear you we as we think we become more tech savvy making sure that we have other other features in utilization is still available the next question is assumed the service is free right yes okay good i noticed in in in im looking at the fresh food for families example for instance and doesnt matter ah that shows the locations of the different you know suppliers are outlets that you can get food is it possible that you could possibly draw the map for them there you know you know utilizing this with their smartphones immediately get a map and follow the map and get to their destination of their two car trying to get to this destination youre gonna provide google maps connection so this is currently like if i can see it but it is this is currently power through google itself and so i dont remember there is a way to sure if you   123036 am  can do it on your phone but this itself is already parked through google on was hoping my question was specifically like can i get directions to your plates oh good can i directly to get directions from here no yeah you would have to like copy and piece it over okay can i can confirm something real quick just to interject there because im on online right now on the platform and when i click on the map it gives me the option to view on google maps and from my knowledge of how google maps works you can get directions google maps if something can be viewed on google maps am i missing something were now missing something i think im missing something i dont have that function i dont see that function on my end okay yeah i think just briefly diagnosing what you said earlier  maybe there are some additional problems with your system i dont know but commission that scoop to if you follow along on   123137 am  the website are you able to do what im able to do on my tablet no i wasnt actually for following it im not connected to that point no okay im just looking at her slides and from the slides as if i can see the map can i see the directions also well my question im not logged in okay fair and fair enough fair enough i just wanted to show how from my part here on my tablet when i clicked on an organization it brought up google maps and gives me the option to he on google maps and then you see google maps is loading up so maybe that that answers my question that its possible yeah later if i could interject if you actually click on the the address there like i see you have it up 6601 manor road thatll open up a google maps tab there you go yeah question and that will give you directions but again is of use for people who need help who are not attack seven would be greatly appreciated and lastly  the question is you using this   123237 am  food printing and for example so he is in your system such that youre making really a connection so that if they need food delivered with food pantry be contacting them and say okay we just got this notification you know we know where you live we are ready to deliver food when is a good time is that a service that youre providing or is that something if youre not then i plan to do that yeah so it depends for organization if the organization has this what we call a referral tool turned on then yes the organism we will send over the basic information so i can send over franciscos information to fresh food for families then fresh food for families will contact francisco to set up everything for him and my last question is you said that youre you know youre making this facility this this this this this feature just capability available through organizations i you also connecting with with companies   123337 am  like dell like samsung etcetera the big giants were hiring like crazy so that they can in turn make it available to the employees youre moving into town for their relatives elderly relatives yeah thats currently not part of our outreach plan it was just mainly for organizations but i think thats a good idea something to think about for implementation okay im out of questions thank you thank you for those questions mr dasgupta  we are running really low on time i would like to extend that same opportunity though to our vice chair and anyone else standing by i guess commissioner island you be the last one thanks chair pitts and annabella thank you so much for running through this this is you  know from from my perspective this looks to be an amazing tool so at the very least consolidate all of the organizations advocacy as well as advocacy organizations that provide services almost in a one   123439 am  stop shop so i think to my knowledge i dont think theres been anything this comprehensive with with this broad access so you know i think this is this is great couple of high level questions wondering if you could talk a little bit about the marketing or engagement strategy with community with perhaps caseworkers throughout austin other nonprofits you know how how are what sort of the strategy to get the word out on this yeah so in the beginning when we first launched it was kind of a because united because its currently posted within united way the first strategy was currently utilize all the networks right so everything all of our coalitions that we have in place thats really focused on early childhood and then from there it just kind of spread like wildfire we started going to organizations to those large organizations that have a   123540 am  larger capacity reaching out to them letting them know the platform itself offering training offering opportunities i think that was definitely in the beginning of the lunch as of a couple of months ago now that with everything opening back up and weve been doing a lot more in person tabling events that wasnt the opportunity before and then the third thing is just broader network outreach to the different coalitions within the austin region that we know there is an abundance of so all of those have been the main outreach usually im the one that needs with that organization theres also sometimes organizations just take the training themselves and that are listed on the website but i as of right now it was in the beginning it was definitely like a wider network and now were its kind of in the opposite where more organizations are reaching out to us to be able to get connected to the platform thats thats exciting to hear   123641 am  another question or the last question i had is you mentioned the reporting functionality and im just curious what types of reports analytics data is united way currently focusing in on im just curious yeah good question so one is the navigation components so the number of people calling in the services that are highly being requested the searching trends as well that are on their how they interact with the platform on what is like the most highly referred to organizations really trying to get more like a need like what trying to get a landscape of the needs currently within austin thank you so much annabella oh thank you for that question those questions vice chair apodaca ah commissioner island will be the last one give you a brief chance if youd like to ask any questions no nothing further    123741 am  than the ones that i have asked already okay thank you for that so with that then id like to hand it back over to you all again we wont have much time for additional questions but like feed it give me the chance to present on the referral tools piece yeah and i will try to go as quickly as possible on here as well so what i did just want to highlight is so that what i went through the first half was just a little bit about the searching itself and this is really now being able to search im sorry accept and received referrals to connect the t x so theres three functionalities are available so one is what we call the one step and it allows an organization to capture a seekers information and then contact that individual that was a demonstration that i mentioned it just basic information there name and their preferred method of contact the second one is what we call a screener a two step tool also kind of its basically like a google form so organizations want to ask any further questions they can do that through the platform itself   123843 am   they can ask eligibility questions they can ask anything to be really able to determine if theyre eligible for services and then the third option that we have is a scandal er so people can book appointments directly through the connecting tx platform and the schedule is integrated with google calendar and outlook i will say this is our least most are at least used feature is the schedule er but it is an option of organizations used to use it so then what happens lets say an organization has chosen to turn on one of those three options and those referral tools than what happens you can see on here that they are then everything is taken to the inbound referrals theyre able to view the information of that individual being the details of the person reaching out and also in really really importantly being able to update the status of this referral theres also translates to program analytics  each organization has complete   123944 am  control over their program analyst legs and we as a connected tx art have an opportunity to view the larger landscape we just because of pepper and quite can confidentiality were not able to see this specific program analytics for each individual organizations on here is just an example of what happens to the referrals so on the left is the demonstration that i went through and here on the demonstration of priscilla sent over a a referral i believed yeah it was priscilla and so you can see on the right is the referral that was received it is in the preferred language of that individual you can see on here there in the information and the programs card and the fertile languages lesson on here as well and then this is  what happens when from the organizations perspective so this is the email that they will receive they can see that priscilla referred connected   124045 am  text demo to annabella i can see the name the email and the phone number on here as a way to contact and i can see that priscilla left fallen comments that is one way that organizations receive that information is via email and the second way is via the online platform jen organizations also have the opportunity to edit programs see all the analytics and being able to access my team essentially what that means is that they have the opportunity to invite different team members instead of going through the entire cleaning process and they can just directly invite individuals so with that im just gonna go directly into what that looks like from there and from an organization so again my organization has chosen to turn on a referral to receive that information so then i would go to like program tools on here i can see the   124147 am  four different options being able to do inbound referrals i can also edit my program listings i can view my team and also view my program analytics for my specific program card for today im just gonna go into the inbound referrals so you all have the opportunity from a organizational perspective to see that option and then one that i clicked on for today this is our housing demonstrations and none of these people are real so we can see on the very left hand side is a status and this is whenever were talking about closing the loop this is what were referencing but like on here i can change the status of that individual so i know the person that is enquiring as test a meal and i can as an organization as united way i can say a meal god help they were eligible they couldnt contact i have all these different options that i can communicate with the person that they referred or the referral which is marcela ramirez in this particular case  so really again being able to   124247 am  update the status and follow the trajectory of that individual im here i can also quickly view their profile i can view a comment and when i talked about the case management features its through the view the profile so i can see in the people that im helping the information i can see the goals that are lifted on here i can also see their navigation history and any notes that i want to make about this individual the only people because this is again hipaa compliant the only people that have passed have access to this  is people with that were added within the organization as united weight cannot see any of this information on behalf of another organization is completely confidential to them okay im going  to try to go really quickly and then i can also see any documentations on here i can see all the different changes and statuses and who changes status the organization that receive   124349 am  franciscos information has the ability to update it and so so the two organizations but also francisco himself if he wanted to update his own status he could have that option on there as well that is accessed through the very top right so you can see my referrals on here and i can see referrals from me as well so this is again its completely optional for the clients or the person seeking services to create a login profile they do not have to if they dont want to this is just an opportunity for them to find that information okay its growing quickly and then the last thing i wanted to point out  and the simple search box so the simple search box is what we call a front door so any organization can have and the search box that i showed in the beginning displayed on their websites and it will directly take them to the united weve portal so if i had a simple search box it went directly   124451 am  linked me to this landing page on here and thats just another way for organizations to be able to league organizations to mm sorry individuals to this page as always gtx is completely free you can start searching and my contact information is listed on the trying to go as quickly as possible i know it wasnt as comprehensive but and if you all have questions i want to make sure and give time for that if possible thank you so much again annabelle we would really appreciate that presentation and for answering the questions you answered earlier i know that there will be great advantage i think too having you both visit with us at a working group meeting perhaps to discuss the things we discussed earlier around 311   124552 am  in addition to other questions we might have so rather than to take any more time now if i can id like to just give us all an opportunity to just say our thanks and appreciation for the presentation today if theres any hot burning questions that we have to address before we break and then well do that now but ah and i have had one in the room at least so let me give a commission yeatts a chance to ask one quick question here your outreach plan with that include in person a availability for a demonstration say in spanish at a neighborhood resource fair is would that be a possibility yes that is definitely a possibility currently we have the spanish demonstrations on the website but and we have those like weve had those live as well but weve noticed that we get    124652 am  better visibility and better usage out of them whenever we go into the communities specifically and get those spanish right okay so we may have availability and opportunity for that at some point in the future so id like to contact you at some point about that and i guess i can seize this opportunity our commission definitely has an opportunity for you o join us at future engage engagements were actively scheduling town hall listening sessions and coordination with our library commission and the austin public library where ah as francisco knows hes been involved in part of the planning committee and so it would be great if you were able to table at future events notwithstanding whatever commission yeatts has in mind as well yeah were always open to more kind of any opportunities to plug in and with the community in present any of this information awesome great i   124754 am  definitely want to focus on that in the working group but couldnt let the moment pass to lock you in now okay great well thank you again for everything that we have to let you go but thank you so much for the great presentation and for all the quality information and really the quality of work that you guys have done in the space ah you know the pandemic obviously put up you know as i refer to it as a blip too many plans and so thanks for getting back at it and to bring in this great refresh to us all course thank you all so much for the opportunity to present and just talk about the platform itself thank you awesome thank you again okay so with that well go ahead proceed in our agenda now to agenda item three new business commission discussion on the fcc broadband standards and possible action id like to begin by calling attention to some documentation and set a little context verbally ah as   124857 am  we discussed in the last meeting  ah we agreed as a body that we would take on the issue of broadband standards and there was consensus as well in our discussion that we could put forward a recommendation for broadband standards at least in a resolution format that we have one so far discussion included involving our local carriers in that discussion so we would give them a chance to have direct input on what is truly achievable for elevating a broadband standard that austin would offer to the community and weve begun that process already stating the effort and the plan to our contacts at google and at t mobile and so we need to finish that process by announcing that to the rest of the carriers but in the   124957 am   meantime because we know that we want to be thorough about this process and factor in mind from a consumer protection standpoint which is one of our responsibilities as a commission ah the current fcc god and so what ive shared with you all are three different documents pertaining to broadband from the fcc the first here as displayed is the broadband consumer guide ill give you all a chance to pull it up as i pull it up as well   125059 am  so theres three different documents theres the fcc broadband speed guide which were looking at now there is the fcc household broadband guide and then theres sec getting broadband q and a trip is city hall may not be sharing the correct file or or screen thank you for that vice chair ah the one thats on the screen right now yeah this is fine but can you see it now vice chair apodaca and the other commissioners online i can see it on the item three a screen im just seeing the folder with   125202 am  30 files and not seeing any actual pdf so whats wrong vice chair apodaca what i did was i looked at the email that jesse had said and theres something wrong you cannot really open it right online so i just downloaded all three documents i opened the opened them up in a separate window so thats how i managed to get all of those documents yeah i can see it on my end but for the public i think it would just be well just to clarify something as well as chair our discussion ah we will have to review the document as a group if we want to look at it all together without reaction and then when it comes to our discussion we actually have to always visible so the document wont be displayed at that time   125302 am  however id like to give a solid chance to review this initial part and as it is purely stating and indeed reading the document for those that might have visual challenges im going to read this initial part and then we can react to it so as its listed here this is the fcc consumer guide the broadband speed guide and what this purports to do it states compare typical online activities with the minimum download speed megabits per second or m b p s needed for adequate performance for each application additional speedman hats performance speeds additional speed may enhance performance speeds are based on running one activity at a time for household broadband needs   125403 am   use our household broadband guide to compare minimum megabit per second needs for light moderate and how high household use with 123 or four devices at a time such as a laptop tablet or game console for more information on broadband speeds cr measuring broadband america report these numbers are rough guidelines and not based on surveys or experiments conducted at the fcc by the fcc excuse me you should use your best judgment when choosing your broadband service i if i could like to scroll down so we can display the bottom portion right there starting there and im going to read this again for the sake of our audience it   125504 am  describes activities and minimum download speeds in megabits per second which is mbps for general usage it states general browsing and email one megabit per second minimum for streaming online radio less than 05 megabits per second for voice over i p calls less than 05 megabits per second for students 5 to 25 megabits per second for telecommuting five 2 25 megabits per second these are download speeds again for file downloading two megabits per second for social media one megabit per second finally can you scroll down a little bit there watching video it lists streaming standard definition video 3 to 4 megabits per second streaming high   125606 am  definition hd video 5 to 8 megabits per second and then lastly streaming ultra hd four k video 25 megabits per second now scrolling down further for videoconferencing it lists standard personal video call e g skype one megabit per second for hd personal video call e g skype 15 megabits per second for hd video teleconferencing six megabits per second and then finally gaming game council council connecting to the internet three megabits per second for online multiplayer for megabits per second and then it continues to list the help center line and alternate for mats this information is available in now i would like to pause and give us all a   125709 am  chance to show up our happy smiling faces ah although they may or may not be smiling right now ah as we get a chance to discuss this information id like to just begin by stating what is established based on the consensus of the commission that there has been broad agreement that these standards are woefully inadequate and as we get into the different areas particularly with the statement that additional speeds excuse me speeds are based on running one activity at a time but we all know as technology advisors how ah extraordinary that scenario is what this means ah ive got very strong feelings on this but id like to just open it up frankly to the group to share your thoughts and i see commission dasgupta has raised sand i dont know he has    125813 am  strong feelings on this topic as well so please go right ahead commissioner scoop to acknowledge all but but you dont want to back up to the text before that it says for household broadband needs use our household broadband died i tried to i tried to open that i couldnt ultra ultra later to compare minimum megabits per second needs for light moderate and high high school household news with 123 and four devices at a time one which one is the right answer okay lets say we have our typical household of husband wife two kids two kids are doing homework i go down the list and look at students where it says 123 or four devices connected and my interest respect that what theyre saying is that yeah the two students could plug in their laptops up to the same time at 25 megabits and can get real work done i dont think so i dont think so 25 megabits is day before yesterdays technology okay todays   125916 am  students are doing amazing things i look at my grandkids the things theyre doing on their laptops and their ipads are amazing 25 megabits one got it or even one of them im looking at least 25 per student so minimum 50 megabits not 5 to 25 enough to chairman thank you for that commission dasgupta ah any other brief comments now because of that maybe suggests that we should go ahead and pivot to that household document im seeing nods in the room im sorry commissioner island i was just going to say i cant open the household one and you compare the two and its not even close to being adequate right well with that then i think we do have broad consensus lets go ahead and pivot then so lets go ahead and   10018 am  show we can that fcc household broadband guide now its briefer its a shorter documents so ill briefly speak to it and then well go ahead and talk about it as a group so again for the sake of our community and just to get this out there im going to read household broadband guide use the chart below to compare minimum download speed megabits per second needs for light moderate and high household use with 123 or four devices at a time such as laptop tablet or game console you can also compare typical online activities with the minimum negative per second needed for adequate performance for each application by using our broadband speed guide for more information on broadband speeds  cr measuring broadband america report these numbers are rough guidelines that are not based on surveys or experiments conducted    10118 am  by the sec you should use your best judgment when choosing a broadband service then he goes to the chart and it describes one user on one device light use it describes as basic functions email browsing basic video of voice of ripe and internet radio it merely lists basic as what is required for moderate use it states basic functions plus one high demand applications streaming hd video multiparty video conferencing online gaming telecommuting it also looks basic for high use it lists basic functions plus more than one high demand application running at the same time it lists medium for two users or devices at one time it lists for light use as i described earlier basic for moderate use as i described earlier this medium for high use it lists medium and advanced and increases this   10222 am  trend with expanded users for three users or devices at one time it suggests medium for moderate for light use for medium use excuse me for moderate use it suggests medium for high use it suggests advanced and then for four users it therefore light uses suggest medium from moderate use  advanced for high use advanced and then its describes what in the footnote basic service equals to 3 to 8 megabits per second and medium service equals to 12 to 25 megabits per second and advanced service equals more than 25 megabits per second and of course it describes as i did what mbps stands for megabits per second being the standard measure of broadband speed it refers to the speed with which information packets are downloaded from and uploaded to the internet and then it includes the information to reach them again as well as   10322 am  alternate formats that this information can be communicated to the public so ah to reiterate what was already stated and just to clarify now then were clearly advocating for a standard that would be qualified as advanced service as a commission a standard that exceeds 25 megabits per second was what they list for advanced service in this current broadband guy with that any other reactions ah or immediate discussion id like to give everyone a chance to share their thoughts and feedback appreciates well we had a recent experience during our conference call on monday i just noticed that your video was a whole lot better after youd upgraded something and i dont   10424 am  know if youve got any metrics on that that would give us a good baseline as to what we what is really adequate for household use for a single person at that time thats a very ah specific and personal  question and im happy to answer it ah as christian yes just mentioned we had a working group call earlier this week and using the same tablet that i have in front of me i was able without telling you the manufacturer i was able to get a higher better performance and i know that my ah service provider at the time ah was without again naming the service provider also sent out some hardware to upgrade my usage and it seemed to make a difference i havent done a   10525 am  speed test ah although that is something i plan on doing and i look forward to sharing additional information on that its certainly was encouraging that i was personally able to get you know and improvement ah and i can only hope the same for others out there i know that oftentimes hardware is the challenge to expanded broadband usage and access but having hardware at all is a persistent challenge for many in the community right so ah im just thankful that were were focused on access to the devices  as well as to improving access to broadband affordably any other questions perhaps less personal yes go tom are im sorry ill get yes our ah senior consultant for the telephone stations ready to affairs office content harmon has a question thank you jeff   10625 am  its i just wanted to share that theres some emerging information from some of the requirements on funding that are being released by nt i a the national telecommunications and information administration they are the folks that released the notice of funding and the rules for funding and for the bead funding broadband equity access deployment the 425 million 100 of 100 million of which is coming to us to texas to support universal access by funding partnerships between states and communities where needed to increase adoption they have cascading priorities and they are listing the following theyre saying unserved areas are those areas that lack 25 3 megabits per second underserved are now 100 over 20 and community anchor institutions must have won over one gigabytes gigabits and these are libraries and schools   10728 am  and so theyre also saying that locations that are served exclusively by satellite or entirely unlicensed spectrum will now be considered unserved so maybe that helps because i think that theyre creating the new baseline that is very helpful thank you for that ah i think that we its coming upon us to integrate that those data points into our plan here and id like for us to discuss that further although i do want to give a chance for commissioner scoop to ask a question or react to the information we just received yeah i think that is a wonderful in a sort of segue to what ive been saying for the last couple  of months and that is you know if you assume that by the way i have very high service somewhere in the morning when very few people are connected and later on after eight oclock i get   10829 am  superior service because everybodys not retiring because there are lot of retired folks who go to sleep already and so when they log off i get fantastic service multi point multi point drop network so i keep bleeding megabits as the wire comes towards me but in any case i think we should have minimum requirement say if you assume that 25 megabits per student is what is essential for them to do their homework and do website search and do multiple uploads and downloads assuming that there are 23223 students and one adult logged in youre looking at at least three customers for household 3 to 4 if you multiply that by 25 its a minimum 75 where i think 100 is the sweet spot that preaching be targeting as a city gold and if you look at areas like lamar   10929 am  and rutberg those are the areas where we had immense difficulty during our senses in reaching out to social media those are the areas that are classically be described as underserved and so those are the areas we should re targeting with the minimum requirement for 100 mega weeks 100 100 down at least 10 to 20 up up enough said thank you for that any other feedback yes communicates right i have an additional question for miss kotani about all of this money thats coming to texas was it ever resolved about whether urban areas would get some of this money or was it all going to rural areas in other words this underserved is that only mean rural pause for one brief moment this is a topic thats   11031 am  going to come up and later agenda item right where were now currently focused on the fcc broadband standards specifically so if we could lets go ahead and table that piece i know that putin will definitely have feedback on that when we get to the next agenda item any other specific feedback pertaining to broadband standards or the discussion here on this i would like comments from the other yes of course commissioner that scooter please allow me to continue yes commissioner garza  thank you as commissioner does scoop dimension as a person from lundberg i would say i joined this commission for this specific reason only just so i can come and complain about internet speed so i appreciate you being aware and im here to make sure that we do provide better quality service to my area awesome thank you for that commissioner guards i really appreciate that i really   11133 am   would like to get feedback from everybody on this commissioner ah ford yeah with 100 big news feed i had when covid started thats the speed i had in my all those advertised at speed at my house check doing a speed test throughout the day i realized it was less depending on the usage of my neighbors i assume but anything less than full capacity made it pretty hard to run you know we were having to run all of our business out of the house during covid and that was like three computers plus using one additional commuter resume and everything and if we got loaded up with ah like if the two of us were on conference calls for or i mean zoom calls for instance things begin to buffer things begin to not work properly i mean 100 megabits like when its when its fully functional when youre getting whats advertised works anything less can be pretty tough and thats you know as we have people that are working at home and telecommuting now   11233 am  i think keeping those standards up is vital you know thats for a lot of reasons i mean where people were working out of their houses and also thats one of our one of our plans for reducing traffic and you know pollution in the city is to keep this hybrid work style going i live in zilker so i was fortunate to be able to upgrade to a gigabit service which for now has solved these problems but i know not everybody can thank you for that ah our online commissioners yeah ill quickly chime in thank you for sure yeah you know certainly wanted to go with what others have said 100 megabytes per second its certainly the you know the maximum theoretical speed for a plan i myself have have one giga but speeds on teleconferences all day   11333 am  multiple family members in the household ive done many speed tests never once have i ever hit that speed okay maximum theoretical speeds so you know i think for us what that means is you know if we if we do agree as a commission on a certain speed whether that be 100 or something else i think in the back of our minds we just need to know its gonna end up being being a worse because of a variety of factors so but you know with all that said im certainly an advocate for continuing to maximize the speed for the community thank you vice chair apodaca and commissioner island before we return to the room did you have any thoughts on this yeah i mean i completely agree with whatever everybody has commenting already on i think this is just continues to be a challenge that we need to as a commission continued to see how we can make it better for the   11435 am   community thank you for that ah yes mr gates so this discussion has highlighted the need for a better definition of broadband speed in other words  you just cant say alright were going to give were going to say were giving you 100 megabits theres got to be something better in terms of how many people around there and how much time during the day do you actually have that speed i know that there are all kinds of metrics for this kind of service when self when the bell system was still around and i believe that there has to be some kind of better definition of metrics other than what is in in this consumer guide because its really fuzzy yes ah you know i take your point   11537 am  in fact proactively ah the last document maybe this is a good segue the getting broadband q and a the consumer guide document ah the last one that i shared if i can speak to that and then we can talk about that and then close this item out with our action and or next steps ah if you could be so kind as to share that fcc consumer guide getting broadband q and a i want to speak to this because i think we will need to either be in receipt of and an updated document like this from the fcc that reflects ah forthcoming standards as cotton suggested or to create one of our own for our community   11637 am  because to your point there are a lot of questions that are fuzzy and this q and a i think its too that i think as we work to ah to create the document we can clarify this confusion for the community or two communicate in the updates from the sec so to read this again okay i dont want to read the whole document but i do want to read portion of it so from the top getting broadband q and a what is broadband broadband or high speed internet access allows users to access the internet and internet related services at significantly higher speeds than those available through dialect services broadband speeds vary significantly depending upon the technology and level of service ordered broadband services for residents consumers typically provide faster downstream speeds from the internet to your computer then upstream speeds from your computer to the internet how   11739 am  does it work broadband allows users to access information on the internet using one of several high speed transmission technologies transmissions digital meaning that text images and sound are all transmitted as bits of data the transmission technologies that make broadband possible move these bits more quickly than traditional telephone and wireless connections including traditional dial up internet access connections what are the advantages what are its advantages broadband is an important tool for expanding educational economic opportunities for consumers in remote locations broadband allows you to take advantage of service is not available or not convenient to use the dollar  connection such as voice of ripe or voice over internet protocol which is what sorority or alternative to traditional voice to telephone service probably makes telemedicine possible patients in rural areas can confer online with medical specialists in more than more urban areas and share information and test results   11839 am  very quickly broadband helps you efficiently access and use many reference and cultural resources to be on the internet you also need broadband to best take advantage of many distance learning opportunities like online college university courses and continuing or senior education programs robin allows you to shop online more quickly and efficiently what types are available broadband can provided over different platforms digital subscriber line also on his dsl cable modem fiber wireless and satellite the broadband technology you choose will depend on a number of factors these include how broadband internet access is packaged with other services like voice telephone and home and entertainment price and service availability they then go into a description of different services im not going to describe each service but im going to list them and then well speak to them digital   11942 am  subscriber line dsl as i mentioned earlier cable modem fiber wireless satellite then it goes to getting broadband in your area contact your local library and see if it has applied for the federal e rate program which subsidizes broadband to libraries and schools contact local government officials and ask what they can do to attract broadband service providers to area is typically expensive to extend broadband network to a new area your country municipal municipality may be able to offer a broadband provider video franchise rights making building out broadband network more attractive to provincial providers talk with your state government or state public service commission to see what is being done or can be done to get broadband to your area for more information for your state public service commission check then the n a r u c s regulatory commissions web page and as before they provide   12043 am  information on how to reach them and alternate formats ah with that id like to open it up for reflection to this certainly for feedback which will likely include a feedback from our senior consultant ah and from our commissioners id like to begin bye speaking to the types available ah i think that one of the things thats important for us to offer in this document is ah a understanding of what services are available in our geographic area we obviously as a community and a city ah serve more  than just the city of austin we served austin metro if you will and or expanded areas that include people commuting from rural and   12144 am  suburban areas around town and thats a very important distinction because our community includes people that are included with then plainly underserved and unserved areas based upon the fcc existing standards and those less plainly affected by ah these challenges within currently served areas but yet with challenges because the service they receive is not reflective of the broad community so because of challenges we have within our ah our geography ah very comprehensive focus is needed so that would naturally reflect ah you know the providers in surrounding counties and those affecting   12244 am  our commuters to and in and out of the city of boston for work and life i think that ah its clear that what broadband is or should be ah has changed so i would anticipate that future guidelines would be amended significantly to reflect outmoded technologies and speeds that are required to truly function and to make the advantages now that are spoken to of broadband but with that id like to open it up especially since weve already received insights from our senior consultant id like to begin by giving our expert a chance to share her insights and   12345 am  insights that you may learn from from fcc as well as i see now our program officer excuse me our department officer rinella hawkins has joined us so hello ladies would you like to share anything or any insights on this particular piece i think mandela our telecommunications and regulatory affairs officer has some wonderful insights hello good evening its brondello hawkins its really good to see you all and ive been listening to this conversation and i just wanted to echo that we have been advocating the city of boston and many mr calvez said that advocating that the 25 the fcc broadband definition of 25 up and three down his way inadequate and we want at least 100 up and down and thats because we are building this highway im going to say information highway for the future we do not want to have   12446 am   like the basic like what well 25 3 is good for one household and one application its because we need to build for the future and as telehealth applications and theres much more video applications that are coming our way we dont want to let you know settle for less we need to look for the future and thats why i am so strongly  is support of at least 101 100 down as far as the speeds and it is it is just its just like the essential service and i just wanted to share my thoughts and supporting the commissions view that we have to we have to settle for more not less or not what the you know the standard is or what the status quo its and these companies you know that build out the infrastructure in our community that if you have more people using the band you know using   12548 am  internet service at one time of the day than the other well then its inadequate thats underserved we need to be able to accommodate and everyone has the you know the service that regardless of you are a one person household or a four person household with three devices or five devices it just it just should be ah its the minimum its at least 100 up at 100 down so i just wanted to support the commission and just share my views and we have been advocating at the you know the cities across the country to the fcc that this whole broadband definition of 25 3 is way under you know it its great i mean if youre in a community that doesnt have any internet its okay but why why why should we settle for that that is like to me is more of a look to the future so i just wanted to put in my comments and thank you all very much thank you so much for   12650 am  that mandela really appreciate that and your leadership in the space anything to add to that cotton yes i do i think that its actually its very strategic and very visionary to future proof the city in terms of having going for what would be hundreds over 100 ubiquitous because its great that now that theyre actually putting in the rules that underserved is 100 over 20 so that gives us somewhere to start we can say great yes that is underserved  but were looking for ubiquitous 100 100 so i think thats really important also at some point we have to decide  you know the whole of texas needs to be connected texas is connected open for business everyone should be connected the challenge with looking at needs of individuals and households over the whole city in ubiquitously connected 100 100 is that were going to run   12751 am  into a little bit of challenge because theres people and affordability becomes a problem for austin we may think were solving digital equity but we may not be because folks cant afford to live in austin so if we could say that were offering 100 100 then leave the state by saying we are one of the  municipalities that is not only advocating with the fcc but also the texas broadband development office and the service providers that we know we can collaborate with them in the right way to ensure that this would be offered in austin i think that we can definitely do that thank you for that gautam really appreciate it ah and i said commission dasgupta has his hand up yeah vespers fantastic  both randall and this is you know this is this is like music  however i want to take a step back i looked at the q and a there is one term missing and we need to add that and while all this conversation was going   12852 am  on i ran a speed test my provider is very proud to remind me that they upgraded me from 200 to 3 15 without increasing my rate sumit i get 3 50 or two am in the morning i just ran a test and i can tell people are signing off because im at 3 45 10 oclock it dropped to less than 150 if most people are allowed in okay so there has to be a new term in the vocabulary in and the q and a its called the guaranteed minimum speed and that is what 100 should be if i get guaranteed at two oclock in the morning those students who are doing their homework are asleep at two oclock in the morning having 100 at that time doesnt mean anything its guaranteed minimum speed in the evening at six oclock in the evening when theyre doing their homework   12952 am  here here needs to go into that q and a thank you for that commission dasgupta can agree with you more i think in fact that was the very spirit of this right with our our commission was that we need to have a minimum thats actually adequate write a minimum standard thats actually adequate so thank you so much for that because youre absolutely right youre absolutely right anybody else have any other feedback or questions okay well im sorry commissioner island please one when was the 25 3 established as the baseline thats a good question this is ron della it was established probably oh like whenever the there was a national broadband at creative im gonna say maybe about six years ago im sorry i just yeah the years kind of   13053 am  yeah go fast so yes it was its very dated this was a step  yeah that speed was dated way back when so thats why were all advocating like you know this is to you know 2022 2021 22 22 the applications the video the bandwidth and all that is much we need much more and so that is way inadequate 25 3 no i also wonder if theres a way to you know emphasized the need to reassess this right is it an annual basis or is it every couple of years where we look at the state and the future of technology and how its been progressing and make sure that we are always you know running running the tests and  making sure that everything is properly done for the community as the growth of the technology you know as well goes you know and i think thats where there is a lag between what the federal the   13154 am  abscesses definition is of a of a category of the service with broadband speed what have you and then where where things are going in the industry where the market is where the applications are theres a lag between what is actually you know adequate and whats in reality so yeah but we are happy to see that in the in this federal funding that the broadband speeds while the bayberry ah they are encouraging higher speeds for qualifying for the funding but theres not been an official fcc actions saying that broadband speed is higher than 25 3 so theres conflicting information but we can always advocate for a lot higher speeds i great thank you thank you for that commission island and thanks for the response of vanilla jesse has a statement to me just a quick answer to the question did a quick search in the 25 3   13255 am  standard was passed in 2000 and 15 at the time the standard was four megabytes per second down and one up so we got yeah some relative improvement so if we can get the same kind of scale then that might be okay right but we need to like now any other questions about this one okay well we have a lot of good insight i think now to take back to the working group i know that ah if i advocated for an action now it would be that we do that that we ah basically round out our initial research by getting this specific details from that gotten   13356 am  shared about the existing funding plans and what they requiring to help guide us that we continue and go ahead and extend the invitation to all the other regional providers to provide their feedback on what the new standards should be ah and then that we essentially work on that research and what it could yield from a resolution in the working group ah prior to our next meeting with the goal of having a draft to consider of our resolution at the next meeting so that includes at least i know and ask  of our staff liaison to reach out weve already engaged google weve already engaged t mobile ah so the ask is to   13457 am   engage all the other providers ah and give them an opportunity to share we want of course to set a standard so the idea of involving the providers is to begin with feasibility and give them a chance to lead ah and perhaps in gender a little healthy competition for establishing what the standard should be so to keep that moving we just need to get more information from the providers ah so i guess then with that unless theres any other questions or discussion on this item i think weve got a prayer pretty clear next step based on what im seeing in the room from a consistent stample and head nods and online and feedback about this issue yes commission dasgupta i completely agree with what you said but with the caveat the   13558 am  reality is that in most neighborhoods here theres maybe one or two provide them one of them in my neighborhood there to one of them provides 3 50 which is what i have the other one offers 50 so there is a lack of competition so if you get all of these providers in the same room will we really be able to push them together saying okay you all need to deliver more what is it what what is the challenge for them to listen to us to respond to and they really got almost a monopolistic distribution of the city yeah id like to answer that and id like to give everyone a chance to frank frankly opine on that minus your thoughts are of this ah i think that defining what broadband is a big part of it because what were seeing is carriers work in the mobile space to redefine what that is   13700 am  without having ah the blessing of the fcc and and so doing theyre trying to elevate ah at least to claim the capability advanced capabilities that would elevate the standard well i think that we need to establish an agreement about what broadband is and that includes what technologies and thats the reason why i didnt want to go into ah just take the time of listing out outmoded technologies has broadband even though they are currently considered broadband ah right i think that we could be looking at you know the addition naturally of fixed wireless of five g of you know other things that would be included and be considered broadband and so like you said getting all the providers in the room will give them a chance to then establish whos actually competing with who you know right now theres only so much competition for wired providers obviously   13800 am  but people are experiencing broadband services or at least the current standard of broadband services and a variety of ways so thats my thats my initial reaction to your your question that your statement anybody else have any other thoughts on that maybe joe pitts just a couple of things so under the infrastructure investment and jobs act as well as the broadband equity access to deployment act it was  two of them together they are saying that criteria for reliable broadband services fiber optic cable modem hybrid fiber co ax technology digital subscriber line and fixed wireless entirely licensed spectrum and hybrid of licensed and unlicensed spectrum so that there is an effort to begin to identify speeds begin to identify service criteria and so i think this is quite timely because we could   13901 am  definitely give feedback you all could give feedback to the broadband development office and were just set for yourselves what is the standard for austin in terms of more competition these are the standards these are the speeds and building out the federal communications commission is looking for a lot of public private partnerships and weve been working on public private philanthropy partnership so thats something that providers are very keen on plugging into because there are these federal dollars coming in and if you like share pitts i can give a very quick overview on the timelines just to see where the incentives might be is that all the providers rightfully so are very much keenan getting connected to the broadband development office and the local communities to be able to draw down these funds through offering the services that they need to in order to qualify so   14003 am  that is an incentive that is being said by the federal government great thank you for that colton i think there will be an opportunity to talk about some of those dates in our next agenda item so ah i think were almost there thank you for that response though in additional feedback about the standards so i guess then unless theres any other thoughts on this one i think we got a good next step on this and again its to take this on and the working group with the assistance of colton and then to work towards having something in draft mode by our next commission meeting so okay so with that then we can go ahead and proceed in our agenda turned on the item three b the commission discussion on the digital inclusion strategic plan and were going to have to   14105 am  make these conversations little brief but i think there will be robust enough considering weve got additional things to dive into for each ah and are working groups later ah so as many of you know and for the benefit of our bar new commissioner we have a digital inclusion strategic plan that the city drafted ah some time ago and we are now in the process of providing our our feedback frankly and request if you will for ah an update on the plan thats now occurring formally although weve been in direct communication with colton and with mandela and jesse as    14208 am  interim program manager about the status of the of the strategic plan there is a timeline thats already been established that ill give coltan a chance to speak to for that plan the purpose of this agenda item frankly is to reflect a sense of urgency that this commission has about the strategic plan particularly in light of ah conversations ive been privileged to be in that included an introduction to our digital equity officer newly appointed angela bennett for the national telecommunications information administration and information administration on what it will be required to compete for many of the funds that were alluded to earlier although i know as i mentioned anticipate coltan will speak to these i do want to briefly speak to them myself because of   14309 am  ah how much funding is represented and the opportunity that it represents for our community so as referred thats whats referred to earlier ah the the infrastructure bill or the i j a is a large focus ah but in particular the b program which stands for broadband equity and access deployment will allocate 42 billion in funding and this was mentioned that is competitive ah rather excuse me the beat program its not competitive but its a state program the enabling middle mile broadband infrastructure program ah and then also the digital equity act programs which is deep that is 275 billion and funding ah and that   14411 am  will be competitive for communities here regionally and the reason why i wanted to make mission of that is because we have an opportunity to demonstrate the leadership that we have demonstrated historically in this space ah with technology and two ah ah  frankly to show the type of consistency and leadership strategy collaboration with other communities ah that will be required frankly to seize the moment for these funds i think that our commission has reflected ah support for this and a variety of key ways ah and in no small part and advocating for having our ah measure austin fellow that was colton become a full time consultant ah and so what im   14514 am  suggesting is that now our commission needs to help as best we can bye formalizing a resolution ah that shows our sense of urgency and our need to have direct input and to be involved in the formulation of the strategic plan and to be clear that has already been outlined as an opportunity that we will have and so this is really a formality to reflect the moment and timing with particular reference  to a deadline that we were told that was shared by angela bennett during our meeting we were told that by early july and thats the date that i look for our senior consultant to level set and confirm that shes aware of that will need to have a strategic plan to be able to provide to participate in some   14618 am  of these competitive funding rounds even though it wont necessarily need to be the final strategic plan it will need to be a strategic plan and so as is reflected in communications to most commissioners and so maybe not to commissioner garza there was a response ah by our officer mandela hawkins that spoke to our efforts within as a city generally being marshaled by the telecommunications and regulatory affairs office and our senior consultant as well as our our officer two manage digital the digital divide in direct response to a request for information that was made by councilor fuentes ah believe the specific question was will we be able to close the digital   14721 am  divide in austin or or how we will be able to and i would like to maybe get some some validation of what specific question was because it was a general question but you know in fairness to councilor fuentes it was phrased specifically and then our response was one that reflected comprehensively all the different things were doing to address it so with that id like to pass it off to cotton to react and then give us a chance to have more discussion absolutely i if i may take the ladder first the former first and then well talk about the latter which is about the deadlines and the funding ah so i sat through the broadband development office board of advisors meeting on june 1st and it was very interesting the controller was present as was the director of the broadband development office and they were reporting back to the advisory board and what became very clear is that they have a   14823 am  statute torrey deadline for the texas plan it has to be released to the public on june 15th but the understanding is that this is a living document it is not a final document by any standards and that anyone can offer feedback by the end of the year theyre going to look at it again and theyre going to try to update it the reason for that is the texas legislature gave them that deadline before realizing that they were going to be other plans that the federal government was going to require namely that there is a letter of intent for the broadband equity access deployment which is 425 million 100 of which will come to texas there needs to be a letter of intent from the governor thats due on july 18  and they need to have a five year strategic plan ready by then or begin the process of planning the strategic plan to begin the negotiation process    14924 am  with the federal government that initial proposal by the state of texas on that strategic plan will be submitted by the end of 2023 they have one year at the broadband development office to develop their strategic plan to begin the negotiation with the federal government on drawing down more funds and they will have four years of implementation from 2024 to 2028 2nd is that in the infrastructure investment the planning application deadline is july 12 and texas will have one year of planning around digital equity in 2023 the first capacity grants there will be awarded by the texas broadband development office will not even begin until mid 2024 so were going to have about a year and a half to do whatever we need to do to ensure that were able to be part of that planning and thats the four year competitive implementation project and then   15026 am  there are very specific rules about what theyre looking for as i was saying they do have cascading priorities unserved first then underserved which we would perhaps qualify at least some parts because its now 100 over 20 community anchor institutions so library school districts and we want to make sure that theyre also so they they be in the federal government is intertwining equity and infrastructure so if state of texas is going to talk about infrastructure they have to talk about equity if theyre going to talk about equity they have to talk about infrastructure so these two plans are going to inform and talk to each other and then theyre gonna take these two plans and update the texas plan that they have statutory deadline of june to provide which ernst and young is helping them right and then theyre going to get a lot of feedback around it the challenge is that they still dont know the details of the call for the   15126 am  notice of funding they have no way of truly measuring anything  theres no measurable plan all of that is in development the other thing that theyre trying to figure out is the rule of the i guess ps under i believe its the beat funding theres a cost sharing match that sub guarantees which are the sps need to match 25 of the project cost and any money that they received from the federal government will be taxed at 21 as taxable income so there is a concern from the controller and his office that this is going to be a barrier for entry for i s p s at the same time they are being required to offer the affordable connectivity program  they have made a commitment to the 30 a month and 50 for one time for a device to be able to offer a low cost and now we learned that there is also a so    15229 am  the midlevel costs so a low and then low income and then midlevel income so 30 and then what so they have isps have a lot that theyre trying to manage and figure out as does the broadband development office as does fcc so what angie bennett was telling us i believe chair pitts is that the state plan needs to be ready by july so that they can begin the discussions with the federal government they want to see that the state of texas as well as every other state has a strategic plan of how theyre going to intertwine and mary both equity as well as infrastructure with the cascading priorities of unserved underserved then community anchor institutions so randall and i are attending a convening that we were invited to by miss bennett and pew charitable trust in cleveland at the end of the month where   15329 am  the directors of the broadband offices will be there as well as en ti ia and were going to learn a little bit more so we can certainly report back in july as well great thank you for that i really appreciate that thats i have a question here first of all that was an incredible amount of information  would you please put that into an email and so that it can be distributed to the commission thats really important information second question is what is your opinion on the ability of the city to actually snag some of this money compared to like the rural areas yes absolutely and to your earlier question commissioner there is so we are part of the cities and counties   15432 am  broadband collaborative so this is together we represent over 73 of the total population of texas so it is austin and travis county san antonio and bear county houston and harris county el paso dallas and fort worth and we meet once a month and were all the urban centers  it is not a coalition it is a collaborative where were sharing resources talking about challenges on the ground level and talking about what each city is doing we also this is the programmatic broadband group that are meeting and weve also invited our intergovernmental relations to also attend that meeting so theyre also part of these discussions and we meet with the director of the broadband development office greg conte is wonderful hes very responsive hes very collaborative and hes even asking for the the policy priorities of the city so were   15533 am   trying to collaborate on that its all very very collaborative everyone is working together to ensure that all of texas is going to be connected rural as well as urban  were trying to ensure that were focused on served and underserved rather than rural and urban we dont want to create false dichotomies its all of texas and well do whatever we can to ensure everyone in austin and beyond is connected right thank you for that id read somewhere where in texas like 75 of the population inhabits like 23 of the land and i think you just confirm that with your statistic thank you for that commission yeatts yes mr dot scoop to ah let me play back for heard from colton and you can correct me if im wrong the dime liner heard was that between now and the end of 2024   15635 am   we are mostly going to be putting our documents together negotiating with the federal government getting the money etcetera and then finally from the beginning of 25 through 28 hes been on implementation is going to happen so lets take a midpoint 26 25 26 26 thats man you know we were talking earlier discussion about minimum speed of 100 megabits up and down in 26 that may be too little i think thats a sorry chair pitts if i made it respond please please go ahead i think that thats a very interesting point so this is part of our great segue way to talk about the strategic plan one of the things that were thinking about and were very excited to be talking to national partners is austin you all have done such an incredible job with rondell a and john spears and jesse and the commission and all the partners   15737 am  in ensuring that austin is at the forefront of digital inclusion so when we look at other communities were a few steps ahead so what were trying to figure out to begin to were thinking about it were planning towards it is not whats next its whats after whats next and in order for us to plan for that we have to be fully present with that means is in terms of all technology and capabilities we have to be at the cutting edge of it with our thinking and planning and what is truly possible in austin and what where are we going next and we are beginning to talk to the economic development office  weve been talking to the equity office were talking to other partners internally externally just to understand where is everyone elses strategic plan headed and how do we then position austin to not only be future ready but its almost i dont know if this term   15839 am  even means anything to us but digital citizenship of a different level and ensuring no one gets left behind what is that look like because we are sort of a semi hybrid not quite hybrid were going to go to hybrid and then were going to go online or it seems like thats the trend if thats true  how do we  ensure that no one gets left behind and that everyone is connected so its an essential service so i can speak a lot more to that but we are we should have a public information officer coming on board hopefully in the next month or so and theyre going to have a lot of the reason we are waiting for that team member to come in to begin to work on the strategic plan is that its going to have both digital and non digital outreach portion and we need to have an expert to also be able to help us think through that part so were starting that process but its really almost future forecasting and trying to figure out and as you know with future scenario planning you can have 3 to 5 different scenarios but we need   15940 am  to figure out five maybe way too much for us but at least have a couple if we go around a what do we see and we cant unfortunately were not like the rand corporation of the 19 sixties where they could forecast for 20 years nobody can do that when it comes to technology anymore its going to be at the maximum 3 to 5 years but were trying to build a system for 25 years that we can only see five year increments of it but i am absolutely open to guidance if you have anything please data board me with any information of this kind of future casting so we can begin to think through that champions mayor comment on that yes please go right in so if you you know this was i mean im just having a little boiling this discussion this is this is this is this is really nerdy nerdy stuff i love this so when i listen to you gotta think need to divide the problem   20040 am  into two pieces one is whats inside the house gave ability that we have to deliver deliver at the fingertips and the technology that has to be outside the house to deliver that to the fingertips and they may be entirely different because if you want to be future ready you cant say well i need 100 at the fingertips so therefore the wires have to be no better than 230 50 megabits the future maybe all wireless which means we may be focal we may be forced to focus on five g wireless to be able to give us the open system that will allow us to grow as we move yes if i may respond to your pitts sure i am doing a lot of research on the migration from three g to five g right now there actually was a convening in austin a few weeks ago that i did not   20140 am  unfortunately here about intel had sponsored it on five g theres a lot of theory but ive been talking to some practitioners about what five g means and what they can actually develop so commissioner dasgupta im happy to chat with your anyone else whom you know whos actually focused on five g a lot of his theoretical right now but we have to build the capabilities for it but this is such a premature discussion but just to let you know that research is being done thank you thank you for the question  and for the response its clear that we are moving in the right direction with this and at the same time that you know were waiting you know for certain things right necessarily ah and were still pressed for time id like to give ah anyone who hasnt had a chance to win yet ask questions about the this should include strategic plan to do so now   20246 am  okay well the main purpose again this discussion was for us to prioritize ah as a commission ah again consideration around a resolution for this and very much like ah the last item this necessarily needs to go to the working group and ah i know that we amended the ah invitation for working group discussions on a kind of as needed basis but it could be so kind as to have you colton join us during our next working group discussion so we can discuss then candidly what would go into a resolution supporting this with your support and then prepare for a draft by the next meeting thatd be great awesome shes a shes nodding yes an agreement yall and two thumbs up okay well with that   20349 am  then lets go and move on to our next agenda item here three c the commission discussion on intelligent infrastructure resolution for context again for our new commissioner garza and and for everyone else who hasnt everyone is listening or not online he wasnt aware we have agreed by consensus to draft a resolution showing support for infrastructure for advanced services and intelligent infrastructure and its one which may or may not show formal support for a named thought leader who has presented to us the autonomy institute in the space however it will remain supportive of the concepts we know that for sure  i have been in communication with variety of people on this   20454 am  topic so i wanted to kind of get that all out there now as it pertains to the resolution really with certain data points in mind first off jeff take the executive director of the autonomy institute shared with me that he has have he has ongoing outreach to ah jason john michael within austin transportation ah and is working towards getting an mou memo of understanding of understanding from jason john michael in austin transportation ah i have confirmed with jason john michael and also transportation that he has requested a template for the mou based upon one that was blessed by legal and we have invited him to join our next working group discussion about that and to then advanced our discussion of the resolution with his input in mind in   20554 am   particular in the meantime i was also shared excuse me some information we share with me from jeff take about support from travis county ah that he is working on confirming and a draft of a resolution which was written for and or written for its an its an aspirational document this point based upon the data that ive been able to confirm written by the autonomy institute written for travis county and its the kind of document that our resolution could also mirror ah so i just want to speak to a couple of the points because i cannot share it directly but without actually been reading it well since i cant share directly now what i   20656 am  want to speak to is how it its aligned with our strategic outcomes in fact i feel obliged to to read portion of it even though i cant display it i do want to read it because its a draft mode that we might share language from or use language from okay   20802 am  it speaks to first and where i statements recitals about the role of travis county being recognized as one of the most innovative innovative counties clearly austin similarly is one of the most innovative cities and its growing at an accelerated pace it then speaks to travis county being the owner of the greater austin area telecommunications network otherwise known as gotten and the combined transportation energy and communications center  known as the c t e c c it then speaks to the advantage of having a partner like being excuse me it speaks to the role of intelligent infrastructure providing a foundation for travis county to provide ah solutions for social issues more responsive services and to   20903 am  develop a future a better future for the community as is directly pertinent to us as we discussed it speaks to how intelligent infrastructure could eliminate the digital divide supporting worst workforce development enabling new science technology engineering mathematics and to help vision zero mobility goals it speaks to how a national public information network node public private partnership program could enable communities to accelerate the deployment of the technologies that we mentioned earlier in collaboration with industry academia government including municipal governments like travis county and the city of boston it continues to talk    21004 am  about intelligent infrastructure integrated intelligent infrastructure for advanced services being foundational for resilient states cities counties and communities in industry four point oh it continues to talk about how the goal would be two support the adoption of intelligent infrastructure for more robust community services mobility agriculture delivery emergency response public safety environmental monitoring national security infrastructure inspection automated services industrial repair autonomous systems including cars trucks shuttles  industrial robotics drones and urban air and speaks to the desire to determine this suitability of a national pen   21106 am  which stands for public information network node p three initiative for deployment in the city now when they say p three theyre referring to public private partnership ah but we dont necessarily have to only they then go into being the resolution itself resolving that therell be a recognition of the mutual interests and benefits in a collaborative agreement that would advance intelligent infrastructure to express ah rather excuse me to explore the feasibility of engaging in one or more cooperative projects programs deployments policy pursuits and or research activities and this is by an entity theyre encouraging like the autonomy institute or specifically the autonomy institute further states that travis county would   21207 am  support the deployment by example the city of boston would support the deployment of intelligent infrastructure road  i mean intelligent patricia roadmap with relevant departments of commissions immunity department partners stakeholders including local technology local technology community to inform policy decision making identify intelligent infrastructure initiatives to tackle local challenges and improve our city services and identify potential public and private funding opportunities for these initiatives it continues to describe how the aspiration is that the county would cooperate and collaborate to identify solutions and support project deliveries relating to intelligence infrastructure including but not limited to probably agreements public private partnerships and other alternative other alternate project delivery models additional ancillary projects seeking to provide communication network upgrades energy grid upgrades related services for   21307 am   the purpose of expanding opportunities to improve operations and availability of county services that include the following departments and the resources it lists community vision communications public safety transportation city state leadership public works or planning energy department real estate public policy community engagement equity financing and operations legal it lists the following of government objectives digital inclusion intelligent infrastructure urban design public policy and regulation zones corridors and regions electrical grid solution providers digital infrastructure operational partners transportation systems financing operations design engineering and then fit physical easements as i mentioned this is an aspirational resolution that   21408 am  this potential model for us to consider as a commission as well to show support for intelligent infrastructure i think that we are doing the right thing by being deliberate and including and again for the record for the sake of our commissioner ah theres already been a delegation of infrastructure advanced services to austin transportation and to specifically jason john michael so we think were doing the right thing by inviting him to come to our working group and to discuss this with us and that is forthcoming so with that steps already been taken ah i would like actually especially with cortana available now to invite you to join that working group discussion as well   21509 am  particularly because increasingly we can tell how resolution showing support for this could impact a digital inclusion strategic plan as well were talking about delivering impact of digital inclusion in such a robust way so what i would like to get conformation of today is that there is agreement that we we should include photon harmon in this discussion even though her focus is needed on inclusion we know that because her focus on the digital inclusion plan includes broader focus that would include intelligent infrastructure from an innovation standpoint which as we just got to discussing is going to be key to future proofing or to any kind of forward thinking planning i would like to get support for her to be involved in and ah this evaluation bar commission   21610 am  of the autonomy institute and ah consideration for what this resolution should state to make it more feasible and with that  id like to open up the discussion and im seeing already nod here black commissioner yeatts i concur with that it seems to dovetail with our our plans for the the infrastructure working group you need that infrastructure in order to create the the broadband capability which will then create the digital equity so theyre all combined theyre all connected any thoughts from the room and then well switch to online i dont have a lot to add other than thank you  for the context but i agree i guess technically definitions include digital inclusion is very broad band heavy but i dont think of it like you cannot have one without the other if youre   21711 am  going to have smart services how do you not think about the word are those services included too ah and so as it was mentioned by commissioner yeatts yeah you cannot have one without the other and as we were talking about this project planning that if were already thinking state level that equity has to be combined with infrastructure and then its just mix like the perfect not excused but the perfect reason for those individuals to be invited into the working group okay thank you yes anybody online wanna share any feedback her thoughts on that i didnt quickly amen yes please grant yeah always always excited to have co thons thoughts her subject matter expertise and any conversation so just want to just want to make sure that that she is   21811 am  comfortable and has a desire to provide that that expertise thats all thank you thank you thats a very good point ah ah question asking just wasnt one moment lets go ahead and give katana chance to confirm before we im like you know the answer to give a chance to confirm youre so thoughtful  thank you i am at the service of the commission however you like me to serve honored privileged to serve you so whatever i can do to help and as randhawa allows me so mandela and my on loan to the commission to serve lets see if she comes on shes my boss as you know im so joyful i think shes off  well give her a chance to chat back in later but thank you for that course chair pitts i am at your disposal okay yes commissioner dasgupta go right ahead please youre meted out right   21911 am  now unfortunately no i just want to completely agree with all the discussions that have happened just one question there are two working groups now have played in this specific area one of course is the infrastructure innovation the other one is the digital inclusion so which working group did you have in mind one or both yeah thats a great question and i appreciate the advancement of our agenda with that question but before we get to that let me just make sure there are no other unless its ah related to this point other feedback about of this just validation it seems like we got broad consensus that we want to cotton to join us right im seeing nods from krishna island and emission floor in the room okay great great okay so then with that then it is a good segue because one of the things that that is behind the question by commissioner dasgupta we had a discussion in    22012 am  our infrastructure working group about how this issue is broad in scope and although it would be nice if we could address it from the uniquely working group focused ways in each working group we cant do that without having challenges potentially with the walking quorum because what it means is although it might be helpful for each working group to weigh in on this and then to discuss it and then for stalking back that presents challenges for us so what it means is we might be well served to create a dedicated working groups focused on one of two things one the strategic plan or to the strategic plan and   22113 am  intelligent infrastructure but because of the way that the subject matter the quality of the subject matter i think that would be well served to do that we would have to in order to do that we would have to come to terms about a meeting time and a meeting schedule ah in addition to that we also have to come to terms about who could participate ah and it would be no more than five commissioners ah so although right now this topic has been really kind of marshaled by two working groups as were about to find the addition of another working group it forced the issue of resolving yeah resolving this potential walking quorum challenge so as i think it   22216 am  through personally i feel the need to offer my thoughts on it it is definitely tied intimately tied to the digital inclusion strategic plan and yet at the same time i feel as though it would be a disservice ah to restricted to just the digital inclusion working group so what we need frankly is a way to create a new working group and to easily let down those who wont be able to participate so i guess to begin with id like to make sure to extend the opportunity for a new commissioner ah ah to get some insight into all the different working groups ah   22317 am  that way you can make a choice on what you would have liked to participate in topically and to read from our document you know we in accordance with the work plan we rely upon three different functioning working groups with five commissioners are less to meet monthly and advance the outline objectives of the commission ah with a structured focus to use used to divide the work of the commission the meetings allow us to receive private briefings from city staff and partners unimportant but sensitive matters will also long for discussion deliberation on possible actions which could advance  commission objectives during our regular meetings like today ah the current working group membership is as follows the digital inclusion civic engagement and strategic policy impact working group consists of myself ah vice chair   22419 am  apodaca commissioner island and commissioner gairo and commissioner thompson beaver so we actually have five members on that working right now the knowledge information and data stewardship working group it is currently chaired by vice chair apodaca it also includes commissioner floyd commissioner island myself and has a vacancy we have another working group called the technology infrastructure innovation working group which is currently chaired by commissioner floyd it includes commission dasgupta commissioner gairo myself and commissioner gates so beginning with our vacancy i certainly would be remiss if i didnt ask if you were interested in potentially enjoying that working group ah   22519 am  very much like it sounds knowledge information data stewardship ah to give you some examples of topical areas covered by that working group they include the evaluation of data mapping and analysis including equitable broadband geographic analysis within those important to you includes assessing and analyzing speed up america broadband data includes monitoring the city of boston web design re pro project although that is pretty much come to a close ah it includes evaluating and providing direct insights on the residential technology study which is going to play an increasing part with   22620 am  collaboration from travis county it includes citywide technology pilot audit and assessment so as a commission we have agreed to take on an evaluation of our existing software applications and whether or not theres a need for streamlining of that inventory ways that that can be better managed it includes autonomous vehicles and smart city technology pertaining to data so and other things which have yet to frankly be agreed upon by the working group that are focused on the areas of up knowledge information data stewardship and based upon intelligent infrastructure relying upon ah robust data throughput we know its going   22721 am   to directly have you know a key role in whatever she planned we have and whatever were looking to promote from a intelligent infrastructure resolution so maybe typically i dont expect you to decide now means but i just want to give you that information that was a good sell yeah ill be happy to serve however you need me so if thats ah vacancy that needs  for someone to take on and im happy to serve wonderful thank you so much i really appreciate that okay so that completes that working group membership it does it does leave us and an ideation still for how to create a new working group jesse id like to give you a chance to win on your thoughts on the process we might be able to leverage to do this quickly no pressure i dont know about how to do it   22822 am  quickly so to create a new working group is simple we would just have to ah as a commission deliberate on what the commission or with the working group would be handling and then take a vote to ah assign certain you know commission members to that working group and then its up you know that group can meet separately to set the details you know they have at that moment commission to go and figure out the details of the working group or we can do it in the large group setting depending on you know what what  which direction the commission would like to go i when a one thing that i want to note is that recent history of the commission has had these three working groups kind of set as broad categories but its also fine for the commission to have very specific targeted working   22922 am  groups where they deal with you know ah a topic or a set of you know topics that are defined and so one of the things is we get new commissioners and im always interested on what theyre independent interests are and you know im wondering if there needs to be a commission discussion either ah perhaps at the next meeting you know i know that commissioner garza expressed interest in digital inclusion topics and that was that working group is maxed out but its also a working group that we have gotten a lot of commissioners that are interested in so maybe that one working group can you know split out responsibilities in some way to allow for more you know commissioners to be involved on various facets of that topic so i dont know that helped or ah is gonna complicate things more but those are my thoughts and happy to facilitate as needed no thank you for that jesse no it   23023 am  did actually help i think it gives me some things to think about because i think there is an opportunity for us to get deeper and to have more robust participation if we can make it more interesting for the individuals although a way to do that quickly is still a challenge but still commissioner scoop do you raise your hand and you have your feedback on this yeah you know  just you know im going back to  your statement about creating another working group i am concerned that people have trouble sort of force fitting it into a monthly calendar as to when is a good time to meet etcetera so im also sensitive to the statement that jesse had mentioned about walking for him so my question is so technology infrastructure working group meets on the first monday renders it digital inclusion working group made because   23125 am  ultimately theres this convergence of interest between these two working groups when did when does when does the digital conclusion working good meat which which week of the month the first tuesday oh that that was my suggestion okay yeah yeah they used to be stacked 123 and then we created pa space for the third one to accommodate former vice chair alexander schedule ah and then now i think its basically but been resolved but with a new chair of that working group thats also you know subject change so you know so far but so the suggestion i was welcome eric is that the first monday the t i working group meets let them report to the commission once its reported to the commission its open knowledge within the commission its on   23225 am  tape etcetera everybody knows mine if the it that the digital inclusion working group could meet the week after that then they could take the knowledge already just shared openly within the commission and shared with everybody else in the city good form the basis for that discussion and they couldnt report back to the commission would that work i mean i dont know i want to make sure im following correctly because the one thing that we need to avoid is communicating information over email that was discussed in a working group to the entire commission before we meet as a whole commission i dont know i was suggesting meeting answer questions like were gonna recording today right right well as long as the report from the working group takes place at the commission   23326 am  meeting then there would be no issues violating the walking quorum right thats how i see it as is right like commissioner was saying we had our meeting monday so theoretically like going down the road we have our meeting first of the month then we do this and then the digital inclusion group meets later and they can discuss the things that we have already talked about in public that are on the record in this meeting i dont know incorporate that into the darren x reported the meeting whatever whatevers deliberated on but i would agree i think 14 group could be a little unwieldy but you know again i appreciate that feedback i think its also ah weve got everyone here at least for everyone here excluding our new commissioner whos is eagerly jumped into joining a new working  group whats the feedback from our vice chair or for commissioner island on adding a different another working group and potentially having another meeting scheduled in the month think from my   23428 am  perspective it might be a little bit difficult to have 14 1 but i wonder if we should reevaluate the current topics i guess for each of the three working groups and see if theres any room to maybe streamline them in a different way or think about them in a different way since these have been the same commissions for a while i know personally i wouldnt be able to help out if there is 14 wyndham im already on too and i know where should we already have that vacancy and which potentially we have filled down but i know its not necessarily we dont always have five commissioners every meeting so i think it might be difficult to get five commissioners on 14 1 yeah our chime in quickly theoretically  i feel like having perhaps its temporary working group to   23529 am  focus on any number of topics that that means for a defined period of time accomplished their task and then is dissolved as is good in theory but you know just work and just thinking through sort of how that that would work and adding an additional meeting i im leaning more towards commissioner islands statement maybe it might be just logistically easier to have one of the existing working groups at least absorb this task for the time being well thank you for that yeah i ah even though like you said in theory it would be great i concur ah i think that what i would like to suggest then is a mapping exercise and im going to undertake as the next step to map because some of these items   23636 am  on the work plan have matriculated and are no longer a point of focus others still clearly are and so it really is a matter of and to your point also i think something like the digital inclusion strategic plan refresh or a intelligent infrastructure you know resolution working group those are definitely you know finite ah you know temporary the working group plans but it would still be a challenge to get those meetings scheduled as it has been a challenge to get every commissioner participate in in every working group discussions so with that i think weve got our next best   23737 am   move when it comes to jenna item three c is to leverage the very next working group meeting frankly so what im moving forward now is that for the purposes of the intelligent infrastructure resolution that we utilize the working group meeting scheduled for monday with the knowledge information and data stewardship working group to idea eight with direct insight from jason dunn michael with austin transportation and ah with colton who has agreed to participate and ah with jeff   23841 am  taku who has agreed to participate as well in that discussion ah so im suggesting that we for the time being a sign this matter to the knowledge information and data stewardship working group because it has the meeting forthcoming and then effectually ah that we be willing to reassign this at the next commission meeting potentially back to the infrastructure working group so they could take the next step ah so barring any prohibition from process standpoint maybe thats a new way to handle it that we handle it meeting to meeting by agreement as a commission that would certainly work chair pitts but like you say only one set of   23942 am  commissioners would be allowed to work on that topic in between the larger group meetings but if it were to be reassigned thats totally fine during the full commission meeting okay so just to be clear what this is advocating because this is a serious topic  weve all agreed that were too busy to have another working group but because of the season of the topic we need to expand the audience beyond just existing the existing infrastructure working group i think so what im suggesting we do is that because we have a need to address this matter sooner than the technology infrastructure working group can accommodate that we re assign it to the knowledge information and data stewardship working group for the monday meeting   24044 am  so we can continue to discuss the resolution so we can receive the ah insights from jason john michael pertaining to this ah as it relates to data certainly but other things as well and that we then reconvene at the next commission meeting to discuss the potential resolution chip it ah yes yes even as i think about that i see challenges but lets go ahead and see your thoughts commissioner scoop messages a special called meeting of the commission so that we can meet with jason john michael colton and jeb to cool so that we are all wed all be involved in it so why not call a special call meeting and all of us listen to the key players because otherwise theres gonna be he said she said this would be too much confusion lets have a special    24145 am  call meeting where we are all involved well i definitely appreciate the suggestion as you know im not afraid to call special called meetings however i guess the question that we need to ask ourselves is our next conversation meant for the public record i dont think it is and i say that only because we have important things to flesh out in our vetting process and we dont want embarrassing anyone involved thats a good point good point but it does put us back to then a need to address this at the working group level and limitation of who can participate so if its going to be a discussion that but   24245 am  ultimately will come back to the technology infrastructure and innovation working group should we be calling another meeting next monday of the working group would that work jessie has thoughts yes similar to i think the direction that commissioner dasgupta is going there could be special called working group sessions as well so if scheduling is an issue but you would still like to keep the topic within the t ii working group i would suggest that you all could have you know a one off for a special called working group session to accommodate scheduling i turned the question over to the chair of the working group and see what he has to say if we did it after the knowledge information group so i can five maybe six on monday because i may or may not be able to be at the other at the knowledge information   24345 am  group based on another meeting ive had on the books for a long time id have to look at my calendar i can do it soon in the next week or two if we can find the time for it but i agree i think it would be easier to move our working group have a special called working group meeting and try to do the full commission well you know you you raise an interesting another possibility and were getting pressed for time here but just briefly you made me think about whether or not you know if you know you cant participate then perhaps that gives an opportunity for another commissioner to participate on monday yeah i think im im im 50 50 depending on the southern meeting ends i could just say im not coming and somebody could have my slot and if that helps well it could particularly if one or more of our commissioners is concerned about confusion or you know ah information being lost somehow in the process but you know i   24450 am   think that ah are limiting factor here is the availability of the other participants in other words diggle dick ooh and jason john michaels so and colton also so ah we need to decide we need to find out from them when theyre available and probably our time might be a little bit more flexible i know mine is so that there is a limiting factor right there right right okay so to be fair again to clarify we did confirm button can join us on monday and ive confirmed that jeff the ku is available to join us on monday ah there there has been an invitation extended to jason john michael and i anticipate confirmation but i dont know for certain that jason john michael will be joining us on monday im waiting for that confirmation and to clarify further ive also engaged   24552 am  daniel colada about confirming colada our interim chief innovation officer about confirming the participation of charles perma and our next meeting as well particularly with his focus on the open data portal and work there so they also pending confirmation would be joining the conversation on monday too alright i think that we need an agenda that really paris down what were going to be talking about so that the conversations dont wander too much we so we want to for other focus of these meetings are going to be coming up with a resolution mm and this is what i believe in i imagine you all concur on that so the resolution is not going   24654 am  to be specific to autonomy institute correct so we need to be a probably a little bit more generic and in that respect and i think that all the participants need to understand that also well to be fair you know a big part of the next discussion is a follow up on our previous discussions ah which were to allow jason john michael and others a chance to have any questions addressed that they had about about the autonomy institute and about the process so it was certainly inform any decision we made to include or exclude them directly right in the resolution and to be clear i want to read something like you conveyed   24800 am  that you have to cu along the same lines ah because of a part of the discussion will also be the status of the current status of the mou right thats the memo you which jason john michael was actually leveraging the existing template template for the current status of the mou and the certification of strategic support in austin for a use case driven evaluation of pins chirp its just a quick note   24900 am   that we have four minutes before we have to either adjourn or hold a vote on continuance okay yeah lets lets go ahead and keep this moving so okay so all right so we have agreed then i think i think we have an agreement to well weve had discussion ive made a motion to because of our time constraints scheduling wise but you need to address this resolution before next meeting including insights from jason john michael has been invited to participate you have to cu charles perma and croton harmon two transition this discussion item to the knowledge information and data stewardship working group effective immediately and then it will be taken up during that working group meeting so i guess ill   25003 am  look for a second for that motion just so we can go ahead and hold a vote on that and proceed i thought one of the options was to have this additional meeting on monday his but now youre saying okay maybe im confused about the purpose of additional meeting on monday because additional meeting on monday is discussed scheduling its not going to be to talk to these parties right so the reassignment has to happen before that right the meeting for the working group is scheduled at four the other point if i could chime in i think commissioner yeatts into that earlier is were not sure if our guests jason jason john  michael and charles will be able to stay past or in addition   25104 am  to that four pm meeting i think we already have everyone besides jason john michael lockdown for four pm meeting so trying to get additional time with him might be might prove difficult in the next 48 hours would it be possible to have the two working groups swap times so that the infrastructure working group handles that meeting during the pre scheduled time its just well have to reschedule the other working group well ah thats certainly possible have to certainly defer to the working group chair and the work group members to agree to that but if that would certainly possible youre talking about monday at four thats the thats the time that i dont know if ill be able to right right so what what   25205 am  what the proposal is that basically that should be left out either way i mean thats whats the proposal apparently you guys want to go and do without me thats fine i dont want to do it without anybody but thats whats been proposed  and i guess its just really what the interest of the of time in our crunch im also afraid weve hit 10 so we have to hold a vote on continuance okay all in favor of  that we continue our meeting for a few minutes ah please do so please lets say i and raise your hand i okay all opposed okay we have agreement vote ah believe eight 7 to 0 in favor of extending she said she said i every sitting a few minutes if i a time okay its and thats it yeah yeah thank you 10   25305 am  minutes okay alright so 10 minutes it is okay so then back to this solutions so question are or is he in is who which commissioners in the infrastructure working group are available tomorrow at four if or monday at four if at all everyone besides everyone besides bishop floyd yeah and to be fair we dont know if commissioner gairo is available either but yeah so commissioner yates commission that scoop to and myself and i will not be sad if or offended if you move on and do this without me do it you need to do so well okay im afraid   25409 am  what we need to do with that license im gonna get them to say what we need to do is to shift the meeting schedules for this next meeting so commissioner dasgupta commissioner yates you guys okay with switching our technology infrastructure and innovation working group to monday at four it will be this coming monday at four pm four pm right alright thats fine with me okay and then commissioner scoop to that you skip for you too yes thats good okay okay so then ah with that then i think we have ah we dont we dont need to actually even vote on that thats something which the working groups can decide so alright its handled and then to be clear on on my end so the kids   25509 am  working group as chair so ill cancel that one and because commissioner floyd is not going to be able to attend that should open up a spot for me to attend correct right right so too im glad you brought this back up so what we did was we swapped meeting times right so the meeting ah that was the kids working group for monday the 13th is now the next technology infrastructure working group meeting which then i think the proposal would be to swap youre meeting the meeting for the kids working group that you chair to july ah okay yet another crinkle right because that the next july meeting was slated for a day thats a federal holiday right   25611 am   so that meeting was gonna have to be rescheduled anyway which is good i guess because it means then the world is your oyster vice chair at least you can lead by proposing the date that i work best for you to the working group members and then we can go from there i suggest just doing a doodle and taking it from there and one quick point since its only one working group essentially that we would need to be rescheduling  those communications and that scheduling can happen freely over you know it doesnt have to happen right now we can have email exchanges would be less than a quorum right great great yeah and advisable so then ah fair enough then we can take that under advisement and work that out bye sir okay vice chair rest was very simple  could he swap for commissioner freud and you know i think he could say yes would be not jesse that should be fine as   25716 am  long as commissioner apodaca to doesnt then speak on what he heard at any other meeting involving commissioners because then that would beat the walking court well and moreover i appreciate the question and the follow up on the question but moreover it also i support first off as i did suggested earlier us having as many commissioners as possible in that discussion ah and i guess the question is then if theres no other interest than it would be your ability to swap right on unencumbered if anyone else is interested also then i guess the network created a challenge right because every commissioner should have that opportunity if they want so is everyone okay with that or is anyone else interested in doing that as well i dont hear one   25821 am  speaking up so then it sounds like then were good and in terms of that because theres still the matter of ah actually scheduling your actual working group meeting another quick wrinkle if we did have commissioner apodaca participate we would have to make sure that if we circulated minutes commissioner fled wouldnt be included in that circulation minutes if it included topics on the autonomy institute because then we would have six box right okay okay ah okay oh wow right so its more than just excluding commissioner floyd its really excluding crystal void i guess ah   25925 am  interesting point wait till july meeting to find out whatever flying you may want to reconsider that having well the problem is i dont know by monday meeting i dont know how long its gonna last it starts at one it could be done it 2 30 it could be it could take longer and then ive gotta its gonna take me 30 minutes to get home on my computer so that there in lies the problem right right okay well now im committed to getting this done and less than three minutes here so im afraid were going to have to basically worked this out outside the meeting and we can so lets do that in the meantime  though we do have agreement though that that four oclock meeting on monday will be the technology from infrastructure and excuse me an innovation working group meeting okay all right so move   30026 am  along in our agenda now to commission updates this is going to be very brief ah for the digital inclusion civic engagement working group of the main update is that the g tops  capacity excuse me tops mini review panel is fully underway including myself and two other volunteers and we will be finalizing that process by this sunday hopefully and then moving forward with the program of course the digital include strategic plan is a big part of our update as well as our conversation earlier that we were delighted to receive from connect 80 x the presentation and what that can do to expand service delivery to our community no time for questions here discussion really so were gonna have to keep moving on 24 b the knowledge   30126 am  information and data stewardship working group ah im going to go ahead and take advantage of this opportunity to speak on behalf of our vice chair whos the new chair of that working group and to say that we have a chair of the working group and hes going to be sitting up a date for that working group going forward ah and then finally the technology infrastructure and innovation working group we basically just had our our update there so i think were finalized with that too as far as future agenda items were going to be taking up these resolutions as we discussed earlier so each of them will be addressed in the next meeting and im going to encourage ah all working group chairs to offer ah feedback on potential presentation for our next meeting and with that im going to adjournment ah and i would look for a motion to adjourn to your five second have   30228 am  emotional durable commissioned skuta and a chorus of seconds ill say commissioner yeatts got it in all in favor of adjournment please say aye aye  anyone to post alright were adjourned thank you all so much for a great meeting in your patients your diligence we made it ah ')"

note that the following transcript is for reference purposes and does not constitute the official record of actions taken during the meeting for the official record of actions of the meeting please refer to the approved minutes   pool thank you mayor im leslie pool chair of the austin energy utility overall sight committee i am convening our regular   21051 pm  meeting its tuesday june 7th 2022 the time is 210 pm looks like we have a full dais here although a couple of folks may have checked out briefly but i expect to have a full dais here welcome everyone i want to take speakers up first we have four people who want to speak to us remotely and one person inperson and normally we take the inperson person first but i wanted to check with mr robbins to see if he wanted to go first or if your timing is such that you would like to go be fifth so its up to you and everybody will have three minutes although i will also note that we have such a packed agenda today that well be going back to our work session if you are able to deplete your comments in less than three minutes that would also be a lovely things mr robbins do you want to   21154 pm  lead off welcome be sure to turn on your mic and then if somebody could do some timerring for us at three minutes please thank you   council i spoke to you a month ago about the customer assistance programs continually poor record of giving money to the wrong customers slide slide slide yeah ing this a mansion whose owner was receiving cpa in september of 2021 and was continuing to receive it in 2020 a month ago i showed you statistics which theyre repeating  which bear repeating both san antonio and sacramento which have public utilities larger than austin energy have low income discount programs austins flawed auto    21254 pm  enrollment that continues to enroll people who own mansions like this at least the last time i was allowed to see the data they both income qualify their participants slide and both utilities have higher numerical participation slide and both utilities have a larger percentage of their customers who are enrolled san antonio is very slightly  excuse me both utilities have a large percentage of their customers enrolled san antonio is very slightly lower because they have a threshold of 100 of the poverty level whereas austin has 200 percent of the poverty level but sacramento has twice the percentage of participation   21355 pm  as austin slide i am asking  slide slide   pool i think we have a little bit of training going on so be patient and the slide will be up   okay im asking again for you to ask the city auditor to investigate this specifically there are three things first check my math once you confirm my statistics ask the auditor to investigate why these other utilities are doing a better job third investigate why austin energy never did their homework when they established this flawed automatic enrollment model in 2013 it is common practice in   21456 pm  most professions to research what other companies and agencies are doing when you create a new program  buzzer when i asked for this under open records no information was provided council austin energy continues to fail here and the poor are losing money because of it   pool thank you mr robbins the next four speakers are all remote so if we could queue up in this order kaiba white cecily montgomery jordan middle brooks and hannah hues first is kaiba welcome and you have three minutes timer please and how  i guess run that timer there and how are we bringing in the virtuals   21600 pm   just a second    hello can you hear me   sounds like we have a speaker is this kaiba is it kaiba   yes this is kaiba white on behalf of public citizens texas office can you hear me   pool we can you will have three minutes we have a timer here i dont know if you can see it but you will hear the   21701 pm  bell of course go ahead kaiba welcome   okay thank you chair woman pool and council members i appreciate the opportunity to speak and thank you for holding these meetings on austin energy matters i wanted to touch on a couple of issues today first on the rate case public citizen is participating in the rate case and we are grateful that there is a process who scrutinized and participate in ratemaking for austin energy  indiscernible i do want to raise a couple of concerns which i think you v also received in written format from sierra club we share those concerns and i wanted to touch on that first the timeline has been very condensed and has made it a real challenge to get   21802 pm  information and participate in meaningful ways some adjustment has been made there but it is still a challenge there is too an artificial limit on the number of questions a participant can ask and that is six questions that  60 questions that might sound like a lot but when youre trying to get information to truly evaluate the validity of austin energys proposal and put forward alternate proposals 50 questions is actually not that much at all and we are at our limit and so we now are faced with not being able to ask anymore questions throughout the entire process so i do encourage council to ask austin energy to loosen up those restrictions also around the scope of the rate case in general in this proceeding unlike the last one in 2016 its been limited to just base rates   21904 pm  and the indiscernible so that offers no opportunity at least in theory for us to  indiscernible the many programs that are so important to customers in terms of energy efficiency and support for solar and other energy services that do so much here and improve resilience and  affordability in our community so im going to put that as another issue that i have proposed to city council and weigh in and in particular because there is very little process currently around updating  indiscernible im sorry there is somebody else talking can yall hear me   pool continue we can hear you   okay thank you so were pretty concerned about the  i guess the   22007 pm  medium and longterm health of those fees that go towards the programs that i think are most important to customers in terms of controlling their bill so second topic i wanted to touch on is the fayette power project i realize that there is a lot of challenges around what to do with fayette and how to maintain the goal of actually shutting down austins portion of that plant i realize theres not a permanent solution but my request is that this committee have a standing item for each meeting that addresses and updates and opportunities for public healths as well as regarding the phase ii coal plant i would be asking you to ask questions about budgets expenditures asking austin energy to bring those proposed budgets and   22107 pm  expenses to council for approval even if all that has to happen in an executive session so that you all can do your full job of providing financial oversight to the utility just as you do for all the other expenses throughout the city  buzzer and thats not to say that austin energy isnt trying to get out of the plant its just that it is complicated and you all are elected representatives and were asking you to really step in and put it on those agendas each month so that you    pool thank you very much thank you very much ms white your time has expired thank you so much the next speaker for three minutes is cecily montgomery is she on the line   hey there can you all hair me   sure can go ahead ms montgomery you have three minutes   all right my name is cecily montgomery and im here with sunrise   22207 pm   austin were a local environmental justice organization thank you so much for having me im just here to talk real fast about the fayette power project i know that and ask that city council takes steps  take all actions within their powers to work to close the plant i know that austin energy was supposed to cease operating their portion of the plant last fall but unfortunately could not reach an agreement with the lcra and i am calling to ask that the austin city council use the  use the power that they have in terms of financial oversight overfayette to work towards closing the plant i know that the city   22308 pm  councils approval is required before austin energy can sign off on fayette budget and i believe that council should not approve most expenses for fayette as a means of holding the city to their commitment to shut down their part of the plant and the reason im making this request is because faye yet is one of the dirt  fayette is one of the dirtiest plants especially coal plants in the united states it has a high carbon footprint and is behind a huge amount of austin energys emissions i believe that and my organization believes that closing this plant would be a key step in order to help austin achieve their climate equity plans this plant has been behind a number of epa violations in the past as well as a waive of dying vegetation out in the hill country   22409 pm  including things that people sell for money including pecan trees that was linked to carbon sulfide emissions from the plant and further water beneath the plant was found to contain unsafe levels of various toxins of various types so yes it is my ask that council use their power to not approve those expenses for fayette thank you so much for having me   pool thank you so much the next speaker is jordan middlebrookes is ms middlebrookes on the line   can you hear me all right   pool yes you have three minutes thanks for joining us   all right thank you very much for having me today council my name is jordan i also am with the sunrise movement austin just like cecily we are here to ask for specific austin to be taken on the fayette power project like cecily was mentioning   22509 pm   this coal plant is 80 of austin energys emissions and in order to meet the goals that austin energy has communicated towards their 2035 climate goals as well as to achieve the climate equity plan that the city and the office of sustainability is working towards this plant must be closed to make any of that achievable but beyond that we are also here to ask for the city to work towards transition for the city of la grange that is a longer term goal and strategy and is to require partnering with the city of la grange where most of their sources of jobs and income also come from this powerpoint but that said more specifically what were asking for specific action on in the immediate term from you all is to really help us make climate justice possible in austin the specific ask regarding fayette is that the austin city council has the responsibility to exercise   22611 pm  financial oversight over fayette has it it is for her city expenditures so we are asking for your approval of the city council be required before austin energy can sign off on fayette budgets and any expenses over the limits established in the city charter which in the city charter article 7 section 15 says that the limit is 43000 annually which most expenses for fayette would likely exceed that amount so you should have the authority to take action and oversee the budget and decline any budget request that go towards furthering operations or maintaining a plant my organization thinks that council should not approve the expenses for fayette given that the city has committed to shutting down this plant by the end of the year this is currently theres been no information shared by austin energy theres been no information shared by the city and were also about to experience rate increases which is going to directly impact peoples ability to live in the city and ultimately gates displacement so it is urgent that you all have the power to take   22712 pm  control over the budget oversee the budget and work with austin energy to help get out of this plant and ultimately to also help provide a just transition to the folks of la grange who will need a source of income and we believe that could come from renewable energy or any good green jobs that could be created in the area so that is our specific ask of you ultimately we are looking for you to take action and really help us make climate justice possible in the city of austin so thank you very much for having me and i will waive the rest of my time   pool thank you so much ms middlebrooks thanks for coming and our last speaker today with three minutes is hannah hues ms hues are you on the line hello can you hear me   we can you have three minutes   hello im hannah hughes an original film creator in austin with texas rising were a nonprofit organization dedicated to    22812 pm  empowering young people to get involved in local governance as myself and many of our texas residents loved last year was the passing of that limit equity plan that so many folks before me have spoken about and that signals to me and  indiscernible around austin that the city council is truly invested in the future of all austin its ares especially just young officers and we believe that the council should not approve most of the expenses for the fayette coal plant given that you did commit to shutting part of it down last year to reach the climate equity goals i understand that that process with the lcra has been long and very troublesome but at least we should be able to expect that the fayette expenses are given the same scrutiny as other expenses by the city as the austin city council as well as the austin energy oversight committee yall have not only the responsibility but the power to direct financial oversight over austin energy  indiscernible of fayette coal plant i hope the council to further commitment to the ties that austin energy has   22913 pm  to the fayette plant and thus recommitting to the changes needed to accomplish the goals laid out last year from the climate equity plan thank you   thank you for coming and thank you to all the speakers today that is all i believe theres no one else to speak all right the next item of business is the next order of business is approving the minutes council member harper madison would you like

the young son who lived there exclaimed to his mom the first order of business was going to be to take a hot shower and the second play video   23519 pm  games travis said this about the smeerns what i didnt expect was the overall sense of gratification that came from bringing electricity to people who had never had power before had never been able to turn on a light turn on a stove or take a hot shower it was a great experience and one ill always remember with that ill pause and answer any questions you have   pool do we have any questions or comments from the manager i wanted to mention the light up navajo really touched my heart i will note that its 21st century and its 2022 in texas it was the rural electrification authority and i think it was the efforts in the 30s to bring light and electricity to those communities who also didnt have it but that was almost 100 years ago   23620 pm  im grateful to know that arizona is moving forward with electrification for the navajo people and i am very grateful with the work that austin energy participated in that is super important work thank you all and thank you to the staff for that anything else for the general manager   tovo i also wanted to extend my thanks and ask that you do is with your employees and i wondered  and i really appreciate the staff member who wrote about his experience i wondered if it might be appropriate colleagues to provide those individuals with distinguished service awards those are the kinds of things that i think we should recognize in that format   pool i think thats a great idea we shall do that well move on now to the next item john davis is our director of finance for austin energy mr davis you are up    23730 pm   im here to present the quarterly results this report contained forecasted as well as unaudited information and is subject to change our audits were published in march of this year and can be found at the link noted next in addition the rest of the presentation you have in your materials contains further details about austin energys financial results yeartodate for the period ending march 31st this report concludes with a special focus section and for this quarter we chose to include an overview of the relationship between austin energy and austin energys operations and its credit rating agencies which you can read when you have a chance at the end of the second quarter fiscal year 22 were generally compliant with all financial policies although our contingency and   23831 pm  capital reserve balances are still sitting below the minimums once we considered the additional working capital available in the form of cash we exceed the minimum required reserves of 480 million our operating revenue through the second quarter was 707 million or 6 more than budget while our operating expenses with transfers were 786 million or 7 more than budget this increase in revenues was mostly do to weather increases in usage for the sixmonth period ending march 31st included are transfers to support our operations and transfers to cover debt service as well as to fund the cash portion of our construction expenditures all of which nets to an actual deficiency of 79 million versus a budgets deficiency of 69 million at the end of march our cash balance was 234 million which was a decrease of 226 million from a year ago primarily due to cip funding   23933 pm  needs decreased margins and the power supply rate reduction attributable to winter storm uri austin energy continues to meet the standard rating of doublea however as we discussed last quarter we do continue to see declines in key metrics which is why the rate change is currently under consideration this will give the utility the best opportunity to maintain that aa rating that concludes my presentation   pool thanks mr davis any questions on the quarterly financial very good sydney jackson is next the chief operating officer to give us the second quarter operations briefing mr jackson always good to see you thank you for being here today you have the floor   good afternoon i am sydney jackson deputy general manager and chief operations manager at austin   24035 pm   energy the q2 timeframe represents operations performance for the months of january february and march from a utility operations perspective these months are vital as we typically experience winter peak loads during this timeframe can we move to slide number 3 please in an effort to aid our expediency i have added this onepage executive summary which conveys the key performance attributes across the major operational areas and i will focus on this singular summary versus going through the submitted report page by page just looking at the upper lefthand corner generation availability is on target for the quarter at nearly 100 for key generation facilities except where we had planned generation outages looking at the lower left key reliability benchmarks were negatively impacted for the quarter just due to winter storms to include the recent february winter storm landon   24135 pm  as you can recall sleet freezing rain precipitation ice and associated temperatures in that february winter storm but overall and on a yearly basis reliability benchmarks remain statistically consistent with top industry quartile benchmarks looking at the top right renewable performance and renewable output for the quarter is on target at 59 for the collective quarter or 187 million megawatt hours and this represents the single largest generation segment of our portfolio at the bottom right carbonfree production for the quarter remains on target with a month of march facing 100 as a percentage of load meaning 100 carbonfree production during the month of march as a percentage of load or 88 carbonfree production as a percentage of load for the collective quarter in summary the austin energy operational indexes are on track and with that high level   24236 pm  summary that concludes the austin energy q2 operations update   pool thanks mr jackson any questions yes mayor pro tem   alter at one point we were talking about a 62 target for renewable but now were saying were at 59   so when we look at carbonfree goals 2035 the hundred percent goal 2030 93 goal 2025 would be 86 goal those are the three goals that we have in our generation resource plan if you look at production in 2021 the statistics were reporting for carbonfree performance during the year of 2021 i believe is 73   it says 59   thank you    24341 pm   vice president energy market operations and resource planning could you repeat your question   alter so i had in my head that we were doing 62 renewable and this is saying 59 and i believe at some point that was either an interim target or when we were doing our power purchase agreement that was the number that was provided and im just trying to understand that deviation and that was just the number i had in my head   thats a good question or at least a point that youre making so the renewable generation is going to fluctuate from year to year i think thats expected right i think it depends how much renewable generation how much wind is blowing we also have market design that allows these renewable assets to generate as much as they can until theres constraints on the   24443 pm  grid so let me just give you an example four years ago three or four years ago we used to have two or three gtcs these are generation transmission constraints due to intermittent resources and now ercot has on the order of 12 or 14 of those as more assets are added to the grid its more of a challenge for us to manage those assets so there are times that our assets are constrained so the point of that is that this percentage that you see will fluctuate from year to year and were always looking for ways to be able to improve that percentage so we have those percentages as goals and targets that are in our resource plan and we also have a renewable percentage of 55 by 2025 and 65 by 2027 and we feel very confident that   24543 pm  well be meeting all of those goals   alter thank you   pool thanks anything else yes council member vela   vela so the constraints on the intermittent generation are those still the transmission bottlenecks from the panhandle in west texas   theres several of them throughout the state right now there are transmission upgrades that are occurring in the valley so a lot of those assets down there are exhibiting some mitigation flags and so that transmission upgrade is happening over the next two to three years and it will free up a lot of that capacity to come through    vela is that the coastal wind farms that are going up the capacity the generation from there is not being able to get to you know houston austin   some of them are on the coast and a lot of them are   24645 pm  southwest   vela thank you   pool anything else great thanks to both of you tammy cooper is up for item number 5 which is our base rate review process and community outreach update and i think we have a handout from ms cooper   yes i will be speaking to that im here today to provide you an update in where we are in the base rate review and share some details about the community outreach that we have engaged in over the last month or so next slide please this provides a more detailed timeline of where we are in the process following our last briefing to you in april we sub prettied the base rate filing filing package on april 18thmitted the base rate filing filing package on april 18th there are a lot of activities taking place over the next couple of months as we continue   24745 pm  the process it is a busy time for austin energy and the participants and also you can see that the formal participants are engaging in discovery and well be filing position statements in the next two weeks and an extension was requested by several parliaments and a revised schedule was filed on june 3rd and that is the handout that you have before you and im going to speak briefly to those updates those updates were not included in this slide because this slide had to be posted per the open meetings requirements prior to the changes in the schedule that were just filed on last friday and so the key message is that the integrity of the   have not changed many of the dates cannot be moved due to preexisting commitments the schedule of the impartial hearing examiner was something that needed to be considered as   24846 pm  well and so this schedule was discussed with the participants and you will see the key upcoming dates include that june 22nd is now the date for participant position statements then austin energy will have the ability to conduct discovery on those position statements from june 22nd to july 1st austin energy  then on july 7th will file rebuttal on july 11th we will have a settlement discussion conference and then july 13th through the 15th again we will have that final conference or the hearing on the merits participants will file closing briefs july 22nd on august 1st austin energy will file its closing brief and by all 31st the impartial hearing examiner will submit his recommendation and then finally the euc will consider the hearing examiners recommendation in october and in early november council will set a public hearing for november 17th next slide please   24947 pm  and as i mentioned there are several participants in the rate review heres a list of the formal participants in the process next slide and i want to speak just briefly to community outreach efforts next slide please to promote community awareness we engaged in a series of community meetings and we specifically used a variety of mediums to communicate to customers about these upcoming meetings we use the austin energy website customer emails social media local press and other means to alert the community about the base rate review and the opportunities to provide feedback we also posted fliers posters and paper feedback forms in the public libraries and in our utility customer service centers we also relied on bill inserts and on bill messaging and issued news releases and provided news interviews in both english and spanish next slide please   25050 pm  heres a sample of a residential customer email i realize this is a bit difficult to read but it shows that the customer outreach both educated customers about the base rate review and informed them on how they could participate in the virtual and inperson community outreach meetings next slide heres abexample of the insert that was provided to customers this slide also shows the city clerks website where there is detailed information on the base rate review and where the public can access all filings made by austin energy and the formal parliaments next slide we also established a speakup austin page which provided multiple language translations for our customers including english spanish simplified chinese arabic vietnamese and korean we also had interpreters available at each inperson and community meeting next slide we held five virtual and three inperson community meetings 45 of the people that registered attended those meetings we varied the times and   25151 pm  locations to provide multiple options for customers to attend next slide we are also still accepting customer feedback through speak up austin as of the date of this slide you can see that we have received feedback from 306 commenters this feedback will be provided to the impartial hearing examiner and the independent consumer advocate along with all of the other participants by filing it  with the city clerk next slide in addition to community meetings we conducted additional outreach to many different stakeholder groups including officials in surrounding communities we serve we also engaged in outreach to our customer assistance program community partners the equity office and attended other community events next slide and for customers and organizations who may not have time for a formal meeting theres a wealth of information on our website including ondemand videos explaining the process and the proposal next slide   25252 pm  here we have an email address where customers can submit questions and we appreciate all the outreach that your offices have provided if you need additional information please let us know and well be happy to provide that to you thats it and im happy to take questions   pool thanks ms cooper real quick question you mentioned hearing in front of the euc is that part of the public hearings at city hall is that the october 27th to november 3 timeframe i just dont see euc specifically mentioned   it may not be on that handout that we provided but i believe its scheduled for october 17th is the euc meeting where they will have the ability to have public comment   pool and will you be presenting  is that a special called   thats their regularly scheduled meeting   pool okay thanks questions for ms cooper yes council member renteria   25352 pm   renteria thank you and my question is you know where youre going for a rate increase im just wondering if all these rebates that are given to these commercial companies you know for them to install solar would they have done it without the rebate   you know thats something well have to check on with our customer energy solutions team i will note that energy efficiency is covered through a separate program and not necessarily in the base rate review process   renteria but it is costing us money though   it is a cost but then i know that it is also balanced against energy savings as well and it keeps our demand to the system low and can reduce some of the ercot fees that we pay   renteria thats the other question i have with that incentive without that incentive would it have done that anyway because now youre saving money anyway    25452 pm  youre not paying a huge amount all these buildings that are being built now are energy efficient right across the street weve got a big hotel apartment complex and even the mayor said last year or been saying a couple years that he pays a lot less energy because of the energy efficiency it has so its really a cost savings i believe these corporations now know that its a cost savings but were still giving them rebates and i have a lot of problem with giving these corporations rebates   pool great thank you council member fuentes   fuentes thank you i just wanted to ask about some of the community participation im not sure i caught that   25553 pm  how did those meetings go   we held inperson and virtual we have found that based on peoples experience during the pandemic they really prefer the virtual option they really like having the convenience to just be able to participate from either their home or office and so we saw a much greater participation online than we did in person   fuentes okay has there been any limitations set on the amount of questions that can be asked i thought i saw something that said there was an amendment that limited the questions to the first 55   yes in the procedural guidelines that kind of govern how the process will be conducted there was a limit of 50 questions initially based on an amendment we added an additional five for those questions for a total of 55 we did have that limitation but yet something new that we did this year wuss that we held two technical conferences where we   25654 pm  put our experts up in a panel format for all of the participants to come in and ask questions any questions they had and that was not counted against the limit so participants actually had an opportunity to ask a lot of additional questions and many parties did come prepared to do that   fuentes and these technical sessions have already been held   they have we held them in may yes we held two of them   fuentes okay thank you    pool thats a really interesting question and point i wanted to follow up with asking if its the technical piece is that phase over or could similarity kind of session also be scheduled   currently we dont have any more of those scheduled at this point i think our goal was to try to do it earlier in the process so that the parties would have the opportunity to ask those questions earlier rather than later   pool right and you said you had good signups good participation by   25758 pm  the various groups   yes there were several parties who did come wellprepared and ask quite a lot of questions   pool and they understood that this was an opportunity that had no limits on the amount of dialogue and questioning   yes we did communicate that to the parties   pool okay thats great anybody else yes council member tovo   tovo yeah id like to request that we have some time as a council to go over some elements of the rate review of the rate proposal some of the things that id really like to talk about as a group because i think theyre important policy considerations is the increase to the bait rate thats being proposed also the collapsing of the tiers they tend to shift a lot more of the burden to our lower use customers im not sure how that really aligns with our goals of encouraging conservation and then im also interested in talking in particular about some of whats contemplated for our highest use customers which i   25900 pm  think is going to result in a decrease for their bills so what i dont want to do is wait to the very end to start having some of these conversations as i mentioned last time i think these are important policy considerations for the city council and it does require some time as a group going through just the basic elements of how   what the test year means and why its been excluded and why having a really fuller conversation about  especially those elements of the proposal which i think are the ones that concern me and that im hearing concerns about among our consumer advocates some of whom may or may not be involved as formal participants i dont necessarily recognize some of those on there   pool i think we could probably have a conversation with the general manager and the vice chair and me to see if theyre spacing in the schedule    30000 pm  and how that might play out to see what might be possible   tovo yeah i would request that it be either at a council work session when were back from our break or  when is our august austin energy meeting   pool august 28th i think   tovo august 28th would be a little later  i might suggest having that pulled into one of our work session days   pool i think we can work out a date   tovo okay but my request is that it be earlier in the month than august   pool i was actually thinking july but i want to talk with the staff who would be involved who would be making those presentations to find out what their availability is that i understand the need to do it sooner rather than later thats very apparent and i think we will all work toward that end   30102 pm   mayor adler very end of july i think depends on what this is is this executive session to talk about issues that are arising in the negotiations or the process   tovo it could be both but i think we need to have a public conversation about the staffs proposal especially on those two fronts the collapsing of the tiers from 5 to 3 and the increase in the base rate those are conversations we should have in public   pool mayor pro tem   alter thank you so i agree with the need to have a conversation earlier and i know that council member tovo has been through this process several times this will be my first i think   30203 pm  i know those of us going through it for the first time would benefit from some of those questions i would also ask staff though that i understand that there were some changes made by council towards the end of the process last time which are leading to some of the things that are out of whack at this point in time and i think we need some sort of analysis of that because choices that get made at the last minute do have an impact on rates and do compound over time and i dont fully  id like to better  understand how those choices played out and what their impact was which is another reason why i think its important that we have these conversations earlier so that we have clear analyses of what any implications might be   pool i agree with that and i agree with how you were characterizing making changes at the last minute it does then tend to throw things sort of out of kilter this will be my second rate case experience and it is a lot of   30307 pm  information im preferring that we try to find some time in july maybe early august to do this we will get our heads together and look at calendars in the meantime i guess people can participate remotely as well so we will see what we can put together mayor   mayor adler yeah i think that would be helpful just because it does have that impact understanding not only the cost of service but the incidents and how that is impacting peoples bills across income classes i think would be helpful too   alter there are multiple pieces that impact people and so we have to have a better understanding of those on the lower income scales what amount of energy theyre using because the rate change affects both pieces and its a combination and interaction of them which is the takehome bill and gives   30410 pm  you their final impact hopefully that can also  its not just the base rate piece that we need to see teased out   pool specifically though this is looking at the base rate but that would be additional information that would inform how we deal with the base rate is what youre saying right   alter right but  i remember when i had my briefing and i dont have all the details here because i wasnt prepared to talk about the base rate today but there is an interactive process obviously we dont set the prices in advance for the energy but there is an interactive effect that were trying to adjust for with these different charges yes this is a change to the base rate   pool and are you talking about electric utility fees or other fees   alter i would have to go back and look at my notes but i just wanted to point out that theres an interactive effect about how these things come together and the   30510 pm   assumptions that we make it is not always true that those who are lowest income use the least amount of energy because they are also using there buildings that are not energy efficient so when we try to assess how the overall impact plays out we have to factor all of that in   pool right mayor   mayor adler and we went over that a lot the last time so i dont think we need to reinvent the forms because we didnt quite hit it the first couple times but we ended up exactly with what the mayor pro tem is describing so if you could go back and find that presentation i think that that  it was dynamic and it addressed the question that we didnt know whats the relationship between energy usage and income because we didnt flow the answer to that but they brought data back to discuss that question as well   pool and that could be   30611 pm  updated with new information so that were not making any assumptions on whos using the most and whos using the least anything else council member tovo   tovo i said this but i just want to be sure that it got captured that is an important question how is this impacting our low income users its also a question of how the rate proposal is impacting our lowest use customers and that has to do with the tiers so i just want to be sure were not just talking about the base rate or the base customer charge i should say were also talking about the tiers and how that impacts different levels of users and with all of that in mind sometimes theres a correspondence with lowincome customers and sometimes there isnt because of the reasons you said but i think those are all the conversations i think we need to have   pool i think this might be the closest the council gets to threedimensional chess is there anything else for ms cooper yes council member ellis there   30712 pm  you are   ellis thank you im really glad council member tovo brought that up because ive just been thinking about wanting more information on individuals who have taken steps to make sure that theyre able to conserve energy whether thats physically making improvements to their home or their office orb just through usage i really want to mach sure that folks who have taken that step and been proactive about making sure that theyre really efficient customers with low usage that theyre not feeling like that for nothing you know when you change rates later on there has to be the incentive to conserve energy  you think this is true of energy utilities and water utilities we need to make sure that folks are doing the right thing and modifying their behavior to be responsible users arent being disproportionately impacted down the line later on   pool i think thats great totally agree   30814 pm  anything else all right thank you so much ms cooper that brings us to our last item which is future items we know that we will have additional information coming forward and likely a special called meeting sometime late julyearly august in order to take up an overview of base rate process and the impacts and any additional information that council may need to have that will inform that decisionmaking and also educate the public i think it would be useful if yall are thinking about the kinds of questions or information you would like to see please send that over yes council member vela   vela and chair i just wanted to mention an issue that ive been trying to daylight a bit which asthe project connect investment the light rail along north lamar i would like to look at the potential   30916 pm  for burying the electric lines that are basically between 51st street and 183 on the north lamar corridor theyre very large electric lines i think transmission lines 100foot metal poles layperson perspective here i dont know their actual height or purpose but as we develop that project theres going to be two light rail tracks in the middle of the corridor and then four lanes of automobile traffic bike lanes and sidewalks along the north lamar avenue and were going to really need every inch of right of way   pool well ill tell you what because we dont have that item on our agenda to have a discussion about it i understand you want to have an agenda item with austin energy to talk about the potential of burying the transmission lines in a segment of the project   31017 pm  connect area i would suggest expanding that so that its not just the area on north lamar that is in your district there may be other districts who would like to have that same attention addressed so that will be an item we can have on a future agenda and i see the general manager nodding her head   vela thank you so much

to have my hair like this all the timehow long does your hair stay like this and is it normal for it to be like this so its just really like a weird conversation that i wasnt sure how to respond to i felt really horribly and i didnt know what to do i mean my hair is my hair and i wasnt gonna change it for him but i also could have lost my job which i couldnt afford that either   i have been told by a coworker that i am more approachable when my hair is straight i think i was wearing natural crochet so i was told that im more approachable and friendly when my hair is straight i was told by another coworker that oh i see the way that youre you know to the way that youre wearing your hair i mean might have issues with upward mobility looking like that time ive had people you know mentioned my hair or much it so i definitely relate to a lot of these comments and it is it really is micro aggressions and its things that sometimes its hard to speak to or you dont really know how to respond   i would wear my hair in braids if it meant i would not be discriminated against   people judged me or at least judged my character for wearing a protective hair style   i think this act

environmental protections and water quality and initiating amendments to the city code council member harpermadisons office 1 are watershed regulations effected by the difference in soils and substrate between west austin limestone and east austin sandy loams austins watershed regulation areas have historically divided the citys regulatory area into two main areas the drinking water protection zone generally the edwards plateau andor edwards aquifer recharge zonecontributing zone on the west side and the desired development zone generally central austin and blackland prairie on the east side the dwpz tends to have greater environmental protections especially respective to impervious cover creek buffers and the ability for staff to grant administrative variances to cut andor fill additionally the save our springs ordinance includes a stricter nondegradation water quality requirements   geologysoils is certainly linked to these regulations in so far as the regulations took into consideration the thin soils of the edwards plateau when crafting code and criteria requirements but it was not the primary driver of the regulations which are related to the protection of austins drinking water supply and barton springs    item 61 approve a resolution relating to environmental protections and water quality and initiating amendments to the city code council member velas office 1 require that all subdivisions and site plans in urban watersheds meet steep slope protections what are the steep slope protections austins watersheds are vulnerable to nonpoint source pollution erosion and sedimentation resulting from development activities steep slope protections help minimize these impacts by maintaining slope stability protecting fragile environments preventing the concentration of runoff and reducing erosion and sedimentation   the steep slope protections are found in ldc sections 258301 through 258304 these regulations protect steep slopes by prohibiting or minimizing the amount of development that can occur on slopes greater than 15 roads and driveways are prohibited on slopes greater than 15 unless the road or driveway is necessary to provide primary access to a large  developable area ie an area greater than 2 acres or with building sites for at least 5 residential units buildings and parking structures are prohibited on slopes greater than 25 and parking lots are prohibited on slopes greater than 15 buildings and parking structures can be constructed on slopes between 15 and 25 if the footprint of the development is limited in size to no more than 10 of the total area of steep slopes the slopes are terraced and vegetation is preserved or restored   item 61 approve a resolution relating to environmental protections and water quality and initiating amendments to the city code council member tovos office 1 with regard to the direction that redeveloped sites provide drainage calculations based on greenfield conditions do watershed protection staff support this change why or why not  wpd staff support this change because it helps reduce austins flood risk by addressing one of the major sources of existing flooding older commercial industrial and multifamily developments that lack adequate provisions for managing stormwater under current code when older sites are redeveloped they rarely have to provide flood detention ponds or upgrade drainage systems this is because redevelopment is required to prevent additional drainage problems but not to help fix any existing problems caused by the sites impervious cover  the proposed amendment would require redeveloping sites to manage stormwater as if they were undeveloped greenfield sites with no impervious cover redeveloping sites would thus be more likely to build detention ponds or upgrade drainage infrastructure which helps reduce flood risk this would in turn help alleviate the intensity of downstream flooding that is exacerbated by impervious cover it would also apply the same high drainage standard to all development whether it is new development on a greenfield site or redevelopment of an existing site additionally this provision had strong support from both residents and the environmental advocacy community during engagement related to past ldc drafts   item 62  approve a resolution initiating amendments to city code title 25 relating

and if there are any meeting minutes or other materials from the board meetings that are available for review all i could find was a 2013 audit of the camera system that mentioned that the board had yet to be established and convenedrelated to that question general order 6167 calls for quarterly reports with specific information regarding cameras are those quarterly reports being produced and if so are they accessible to the council similarly are they accessible to the public if they are accessible how do we request to see those reports apd general order 6163 requires the public safety camera advisory board to meet at least annually or more frequently as required by operational needs the advisory board last met may 2018   quarterly reports are produced to ensure halo cameras are functioning correctly and that their use is limited to prevention and deterrence of criminal activity identification of criminal activity and to capture video evidence given that the quarterly reports

currently doing in rebuilding our citywide corridor and district planning approaches  in terms of scope they accomplish the same planning outcomes this ifc and council direction for equitable transit oriented development etod planning program in response to resolution 20210610093 include similar equity and antidisplacement focused planning strategies to implement the imagine austin comprehensive plan austin housing blueprint and austin strategic mobility plan the current etod planning program will deliver planning services along the entire project connect system over the years ahead including the majority of imagine austin corridors and centers etod planning along project connect lines will start with the approved project connect lines to consider land use changes along the initial transportation investment routes with an estimated 98 stations covered by the systemwide etod policy plan future regulatory changes could include early adoption of systemwide regulatory changes needed to support affordability increase transit ridership and prevent displacement development of detailed regulating plans at designated station areas andor amendments to existing station  area regulating plans for more details about the etod planning please see the may 31 etod updated memo  2 is it typical or best practice to codify planning approaches and methods what are the pros and cons planning processes approaches and methods are typically described in the operating procedures of citys planning program and not codified  codes such as the ldc are tools for implementing policies in adopted plans and it is best practice to distinguish plans from codes to avoid conflation codes establish standards and review procedures for development applications whereas the citys planning program defines how and when plans for various areas of the city are prepared to ensure flexibility so that planning activities can be right sized for different areas and scales staff discourages codifying planning processes in the land development code in alignment with similar cities such as denver raleigh nashville and seattle  which all have small area planning programs without codifying planning actions  staff believe the city of austin will continue to follow common industry best practices  codifying planning as described in the ifc could hinder the citys ability to prepare and deliver additional planning services to austin residents because future changes to the framework criteria prioritized areas or community engagement processes could limit flexibility andor require code amendments that delay preparation of plans   3 how will codifying planning as described in the ifc enhance or accelerate the departments ability to prepare more plans codifying planning processes would not enhance the departments ability to prepare more plans as the limiting factor is staff capacity  which a change in code would not alleviate current staff focus in alignment with council direction and priority includes the equitable tod planning program the northeast austin district plan palm district plan south central waterfront regulating plan numerous code amendments and staffing

17 2022 and april 13 2022  during these discussions participants raised concerns that their character was judged based on their natural hair and that this judgement affected how they were treated in the workplace housing public spaces etc  at each of the workshops where asked the majority of responding participants stated they felt they were treated differently when wearing natural hair or a protective hairstyle  below are some of the comments made during these sessions   i was called a gang member for wearing my hear in cornrows   my supervisors supervisor pull sic me to the side to ask was it normal or natural for me to have my hair like this all the timehow long does your hair stay like this and is it normal for it to be like this so its just really like a weird conversation that i wasnt sure how to respond to i felt really horribly and i didnt know what to do i mean my hair is my hair and i wasnt gonna change it for him but i also could have lost my job which i couldnt afford that either   i have been told by a coworker that i am more approachable when my hair is straight i think i was wearing natural crochet so i was told that im more approachable and friendly when my hair is straight i was told by another coworker that oh i see the way that youre you know to the way that youre wearing your hair i mean might have issues with upward mobility looking like that time ive had people you know mentioned my hair or much it so i definitely relate to a lot of these comments and it is it really is micro aggressions and its things that sometimes its hard to speak to or you dont really know how to respond   i would wear my hair in braids if it meant i would not be discriminated against   people judged me or at least judged my character for wearing a protective hair style   i think this act should be in every state in america   i am perceived differently in the workplace or office environment and even in social settings when i wear a natural hair style versus

amendments to the city code  questionanswer  council member tovos office 1 with regard to the direction that redeveloped sites provide drainage calculations based on greenfield conditions do watershed protection staff support this change why or why not  wpd staff support this change because it helps reduce austins flood risk by addressing one of the major sources of existing flooding older commercial industrial and multifamily developments that lack adequate provisions for managing stormwater under current code when older sites are redeveloped they rarely have to provide flood detention ponds or upgrade drainage systems this is because redevelopment is required to prevent additional drainage problems but not to help fix any existing problems caused by the sites impervious cover  the proposed amendment would require redeveloping sites to manage stormwater as if they were undeveloped greenfield sites with no impervious cover redeveloping sites would thus be more likely to build detention ponds or upgrade drainage infrastructure which helps reduce flood risk this would in turn help alleviate the intensity of downstream flooding that is exacerbated by impervious cover it would also apply the same high drainage standard to all development whether it is new development on a greenfield site or redevelopment of an existing site additionally this provision had strong support from both residents and the environmental advocacy community during engagement related to past ldc drafts    council question and answer   related to  item 61  meeting date  june 9 2022 additional

watershed regulations effected by the difference in soils and substrate between west austin limestone and east austin sandy loams  austins watershed regulation areas have historically divided the

handheld metal detector wands and recommendations related to additional technology  questionanswer   council member velas office 1 under apd general order 6163 there is a public safety camera advisory board that is supposed to provide various oversight as laid out in 61631 i could not find any information on whether that board has ever actually convened and if so what their meeting schedule is when they have previously met and if there are any meeting minutes or other materials from the board meetings that are available for review all i could find was a 2013 audit of the camera system that mentioned that the board had yet to be established and convenedrelated to that question general order 6167 calls for quarterly reports with specific information regarding cameras are those quarterly reports being produced and if so are they accessible to the council similarly are they accessible to the public if they are accessible how do we request to see those reports apd general order 6163 requires the public safety camera advisory board to meet at least annually or more frequently as required by operational needs the advisory board last met may 2018   quarterly reports are produced to ensure halo cameras are functioning correctly and that their use is limited to prevention and deterrence of criminal activity identification of criminal activity and to capture video evidence given that the quarterly reports contain law enforcement sensitive information they are not available in a platform accessible to the public quarterly public safety camera system reports will be made available to council members upon request     council question and answer   related to  item 69  meeting date  june 9 2022 additional answer information approve a resolution related to planning at a district level and initiating city code amendments  questionanswer   mayor adlers office 1 how does direction in the ifc differ from what the staff are currently doing in rebuilding our citywide corridor and district planning approaches  in terms of scope they accomplish the same planning outcomes this ifc and council direction for equitable transit oriented development etod planning program in response to resolution 20210610093 include similar equity and antidisplacement focused planning strategies to implement the imagine austin comprehensive plan austin housing blueprint and austin strategic mobility plan the current etod planning program will deliver planning services along the entire project connect system over the years ahead including the majority of imagine austin corridors and centers etod planning along project connect lines will start with the approved project connect lines to consider land use changes along the initial transportation investment routes with an estimated 98 stations covered by the systemwide etod policy plan future regulatory changes could include early adoption of systemwide regulatory changes needed to support affordability increase transit ridership and prevent displacement development of detailed regulating plans at designated station areas andor amendments to existing station area regulating plans for more details about the etod planning please see the may 31 etod updated memo   2 is it typical or best practice to codify planning approaches and methods what are the pros and cons planning processes approaches and methods are typically described in the operating procedures of citys planning program and not codified   codes such as the ldc are tools for implementing policies in adopted plans and it is best practice to distinguish plans from codes to avoid conflation codes establish standards and review procedures for development applications whereas the citys planning program defines how and when plans for various areas of the city are prepared to ensure flexibility so that planning activities can be right sized for different areas and scales staff discourages codifying planning processes in the land development code in alignment with similar cities such as denver raleigh nashville and seattle  which all have small area planning programs without codifying planning actions  staff believe the city of austin will continue to follow common industry best practices   codifying planning as described in the ifc could hinder the citys ability to prepare and deliver additional planning services to austin residents because future changes to the framework criteria prioritized areas or community engagement processes could limit flexibility andor require code amendments that delay preparation of plans     3 how will codifying planning as described in the ifc enhance or accelerate the departments ability to prepare more plans codifying planning processes would not enhance the departments ability to prepare more plans as the limiting factor is staff capacity  which a change in code would not alleviate current staff focus in alignment with council direction and priority includes the equitable tod planning program the northeast austin district plan palm district plan south central waterfront regulating plan numerous code amendments and staffing numerous boards and commissions to ensure quality of service and clarity in communication of planning activities staff have developed more streamlined and consistent small area planning processes and deliverables      council question and answer   related to  item 80  meeting date  june 9 2022 additional answer information conduct a public hearing and consider an ordinance amending city code chapter 252 subchapter e section 43 relating to vertical mixed use buildings  questionanswer   mayor pro tem alters office 1  in a previous qa we requested information regarding how many vmu properties have a sufficient amount of single family zoned land or uses within 200 feet of their parcel that would allow those properties to constitute at least 20 of the total property within 200 feet of the vmu parcel and we requested a map of both of these scenarios we understand from the staff response that additional staff capacity would be needed for the level of detail requested can staff please provide greater clarity on the amount of capacity it would require to provide this information and please describe how the information we are requesting would significantly differ from the work that went into creating the interactive map that staff created for this item the difference in the analyses is that this request would require individual analysis of 1675 parcels with vmu zoning compared with the completed analysis that shows the impact of uniform compatibility regulations on all of those parcels the uniformity of compatibility standards enables them to be analyzed at a policy level whereas protest rights verification analyses are typically prepared on a casebycase basis because they are time and resource intensive to conduct the requested analyses could take up to two months to complete given the current workload and capacity of hpd staff at this time     council question and answer   related to  item 85  meeting date  june 9 2022 additional answer information conduct a public hearing on the citys draft home american rescue plan homearp allocation plan that will be submitted to us department of housing and urban development as part of the citys application for 11441252 in federal funding through a homearp

filings at a rate 199 greater than average as of april 9th 2022 this trend demonstrates the unmet need for tenant protections rental assistance and other programs that prevent households from becoming homeless can staff please detail the funding amounts funding sources and interventions anticipated to support tenant rental assistance not supportive services in the upcoming fiscal year please specify what if any amount we anticipate spending from federal dollars and what if any amounts we anticipate will be funded with local tax dollars  utilizing primarily federal funds hpd provided more than 70 million in emergency rental assistance to more than 8000 lowincome households since the beginning of the pandemic unfortunately federal funding for emergency rental assistance is no longer available and there are no state nor federal dollars available in the upcoming fiscal year locally the upcoming fiscal year proposed budget for the city is in development and the community development commission budget recommendation for emergency rental assistance is under consideration within the framework of all other budgetary decisions and recommendations  ')"

item number 61 has been pulled by councilmember kelly and were going to consider 61 in executive session item number 65 has been pulled for executive session   mayor   mayor adler yes   61 i did not pull for executive session it was 65 61 is just to be discussed in person thank you   mayor adler lets pull 61 just to be discussed   and 65 is executive session   mayor adler 65 is in executive session   kelly thank you   mayor adler item number 80   101605 am  will also not be taken up until we have the chance to discuss that in executive session so in executive session today  lets talk about this ms morgan in executive session we have number 65 we have number 80 and i think we should also pull the land development code item so we can discuss those in executive session and im thinking specifically about item 66 in executive session and then the  whats the vmu item 80 okay we already have that one   101710 am  okay so those two will be discussed in executive session 80 and 66 as well as 65 okay yes mayor pro tem    alter i would rather not pull it or i  taken up later but weve been trying to get a copy of the management plan for the downtown austin alliance thats part of item 10 and we have not been able to see that so if we could try and get that so that my office can review that before we vote on that later id appreciate it otherwise i will be asking to wait a week until we can actually review the plan that we are approving   mayor adler okay if staff could post that into backup on this item that would be helpful and maybe we can email it out to the council offices okay   mayor   mayor adler yes   for pulled items you said 62 but i wonder if you meant   101810 am  66 when you were talking about the land development    mayor adler yes item 66 i think there are some amendments to 62 that people seem to be offering but we can probably leave it on consent lets see if theyre going to be discussed a lot if they are then well pull 62 i dont know if the amendments are going to be agreed to or not werent there some amendments on adu no 62 is staying on consent   mayor i believe mayor pro tem has an amendment shed like to bring forward but i have not seen it yet   mayor adler okay   we thought it was distributed but well figure that out   mayor adler okay i think that there are some direction that councilmember fuentes has intended on item 56 and 57 and thats short   101911 am  were going to leave that on consent councilmember kitchen   kitchen i have a very short question on that same one i think it can stay on consent   mayor adler 56 and 57   kitchen yeah    mayor adler that sounds good all right so the consent agenda is items 174 and 121 through 124 items im showing being pulled right now are item 10 61 65 and 66 okay councilmember tovo its not on consent thats a public hearing   tovo mayor i have  i would like to pull 52   mayor adler okay so we will add 52 thats the asmp   tovo i have the desire   102014 am  to  excuse me  add some direction and make some comments about 14 though i dont want staff to have to stay all day to hear and participate in that so if its all right with you all id like to just leave it on consent im going to follow up my direction with the ifc ive been talking about regarding real estate so well have other opportunities i just want to air them today and then im pulling 124 please   mayor adler generally speaking the direction on 14 is to do what   tovo do you want me to talk about the direction sure things like making sure  one i want to talk about a few elements of this particular lease that came through my conversations with michael gates i can be very short two i want to offer some suggestions or some direction to staff that in the future we make sure that those kinds of elements are included in the backup and three that all leases do come to council i believe thats been the practice but its not the   102114 am  policy im going to follow some of these things up with the ifc and there might be one or two other things but its going to be four minutes probably   mayor adler sounds good so were also going to pull item number 124 okay mayor pro tem   alter i would like to postpone item 57 to next week we just got new maps for the speeds and i had several streets that were not included in the resolution that were on the original maps that are not on the other maps and since we got resolved what the discrepancy was i have not been able to talk through the streets directly with atd so i dont know if we need to make them wait around all day   mayor adler does anybody have any objection to postponing item 57   kitchen i have a question   mayor adler go ahead   kitchen my question related to a particular street too similar situation to what    102214 am  you just said mayor pro tem so thats item 57 right not 56 so we just need to postpone one is that what youre thinking   alter so its the speed limit one not asmp   kitchen yeah im talking about the speed limit one   alter thats the one i was asking if we could postpone until next week   mayor adler there are two speed limit ones 56 and 57 right   alter i dont remember   mayor adler there are two    alter im talking about 57   mayor adler okay   im sorry i missed that conversation mayor pro tem   mayor adler the mayor pro tem is asking to pull item 57 to postpone 57 until next week   for what reason   alter the original backup had streets in my district that were having their speed limits reduced that were not included in the resolution and when we asked about the discrepancy they produced new maps and theres   102314 am  three streets with thought were getting reduced speeds that are not that i want to talk through with atd directly because they originally included the wrong map   mayor adler okay so i gather then that theres not a request to pull or postpone item 56 at this point yes   harpermadison you asked whether or not there was any objection to postponing number 57 i dont have any objection but i do wonder if we could  councilwoman fuentes and councilmember kitchen both wanted to pull the item for discussion i wonder if we can hear what their concerns were so we can take those things into consideration while its postponed   mayor adler okay yes we can do that were going to pull 56 and 57 lets just pull them and well postpone 56 yes councilmember kelly    57 is the one that i want postponed was there a question on    102415 am   mayor adler no   alter on 56 or was it on 57   mayor adler it looks like there was direction on them both so were going to pull 56 and 57 were going to postpone 57 but after we have our discussion   kitchen okay   mayor adler councilmember kelly im sorry more on this issue   kitchen yeah i was going to specify my question is on 57   mayor adler okay councilmember kelly   kelly on item 62 i feel comfortable leaving that on consent i was given the motion sheet by mayor pro tem and it actually strengthens the resolution as a whole and id like to accept it as a friendly amendment ill make my comments on the resolution that i sponsored during the consent agenda comments   mayor adler sounds good then we will keep 62   kitchen what is the amendment to 62 could you tell us again   i believe it was distributed yesterday but if nobody has it   102516 am  we can  do we need to distribute it again   mayor adler why dont you distribute it again   i didnt see it so   kitchen what does it do   alter so i believe katie powers has it and if she could redistribute it for item 62 so item 62 i moved to amend line 51 to add additionally the city council further directs the city manager to review all amendments adopted within the last two years to the austin energy design criteria manual and utilities criteria manual that could affect the feasibility of constructing an adu on a lot and provide council with potential recommendations to mitigate any identified impact    mayor adler sounds good without objection  does anybody have objection to that amendment being added to item 62 that amendment is added and it remains on the consent agenda   102616 am   i think we need a base motion   mayor adler im sorry   considered it friendly it i add it as a sponsor   mayor adler you dont need to i just added it without objection the item on our agenda on consent includes that amendment the motion to pass it will be the motion to approve the consent agenda councilmember vela   vela mayor i have some questions on item 3   mayor adler okay   vela and i dont necessarily need to pull it but i would like to ask staff a few questions about it   mayor adler if staff would be prepared on that we wont pull it assuming its going to be short well leave it on consent councilmember renteria   renteria i have an amendment that im going to be bringing up on item 61 get staff to print out the yellow sheet   mayor adler sounds good that items been pulled councilmember fuentes   fuentes thank you mayor and colleagues   102716 am  i have two amendments on item 59 the ebike resolution i have copies here at the dais for consideration   mayor adler okay has everybody seen those anybody not seen those okay so well take note of that my understanding is is councilmember alter  mayor pro tem alter also has an amendment on 59 as well so make sure that you find that and see that lets go to speakers if we can   mayor i have a couple things   mayor adler im sorry   thats all right   mayor adler councilmember ellis    ellis speak up on 59 im comfortable with pulling that ive accepted the mayor pro tems amendment as friendly and im still reviewing councilmember fuentes suggestions and might offer similar but alternatives alternative language on item 69 the districtlevel planning i wanted to pull that   102817 am  so i could understand the intent of the version two i know theres been some verbiage on the message board about the change but i just wanted a moment for us to be able to discuss it with the sponsor as a dais   mayor adler so lets pull 69   kitchen so mayor perhaps we can leave 69 on consent we can  i think we can answer councilmember ellis questions very quickly the substitutes been approved by the staff and its just allowing for ordinance instead of requiring something to be in the land development code that is the only change so id like to have the opportunity to perhaps leave it on conisnt consentwe have time and i can make sure that councilmember ellis has a better explanation of the changes in between time if she wants to pull it    mayor adler the request has been made but theres an hour before we get back to this   102919 am  were going to pull it right now councilmember ellis if you and your staff could look at that you can tell us at the end of the hour whether you want it to stay be pulled or put back on consent   kitchen that makes sense   ellis thank you   mayor adler on item number 59 im seeing thats staying on consent you like the amendments from councilmember fuentes and from the mayor pro tem so were going to leave that on consent everybody should try to find those an hour from now if anybody wants to pull 59 to discuss those in greater detail we will but for right now thats staying on consent yes councilmember tovo   tovo mayor you talking about how we were going to take up speakers today and i want to be sure im understanding so were you suggesting that folks here signed up on the consent agenda would  if they are not speaking about vmu and compatibility is their time   103020 am   being limited beyond three minutes   mayor adler yes one minute for people speaking except over half the people are speaking on those two items the vmu item and the corridor item and those folks are going to get two minutes each   tovo i have some concerns about limiting people who came to talk about some of the other consent items because there are two big issues that have generated a lot of speakers so i would like to ask that we consider that and have folks who came to speak about other items being allocated their regular time it is challengings a a community member if youve prepared a threeminute talk its tough to find out there are a lot of speakers on another issue so its only one minute   mayor adler if we give everybody three minutes were adding a couple hours to the meeting today which means we dont get done with speakers until afternoon and we cant do our first piece of business until 300 today so weve been keeping this time   103122 am  to a minute i think that it has generally been  well take a vote in second been a relatively good balancing of the situation that has no good choices the longer we postpone things we then have some people that have to speak during dinner or later and then people complain that theyre not being given the opportunity to be able to speak so however we do this were denying some people the ability to speak at all or to speak to the full length   tovo may i propose that we consider two minutes and that we also as a council  i think i had asked for this to be back on our work session to talk through how we take up speakers now that were back in person when we  before the pandemic when we issues we knew were going to draw lots of speakers it was a time certain if people wanted to come earlier they could but otherwise that was a block of time we set aside absolutely we have a nutty agenda this week   103223 am  next weeks nutty too they both have lots of meaty issues on them and were going to have to spend the time it takes to do all of them or were going to have to make choices about which ones we can delay and i dont want it to come on the back of public participation so i would suggest that for non62  non66 and 80 that we allow people two minutes   mayor adler okay and then this afternoon speakers or just this change for the morning   tovo whats the situation  i was stuck on the morning consent and i missed what was the zoning   mayor adler its the zoning cases and i was going to have people speak for one minute each i think theres over 60 speakers set for zoning    tovo are there several primary  let me take a look at the speakers   mayor adler right now the default is one minute as weve been doing on zoning cases councilmember kelly   kelly so this is a subject id like to explore in more detail in a work session as well ive always found it  especially before i was on council  disingenuous that we hear the comments from the public on the day that were voting on the items   103323 am  theres a lot of people who come before us that i have further questions for and would like to speak to in more detail especially now that im on council if we could talk about best practices in other cities or the way they do that ahead of council meetings i definitely would like the opportunity to explore it further   mayor adler okay i think it makes sense for us however this gets resolved today manager to get a best practice and talk about how we do speakers because however we do this were having to make  were helping some people and hurting other people councilmember kitchen   kitchen i apologize i couldnt quite hear where it landed what is the plan   mayor adler the motion is to give everyone speaking in the morning two minutes rather than just the people speaking on those two items   kitchen okay   mayor adler thats the motion   kitchen so what were saying is item 66 and 80 people get two minutes and the motion is to allow everyone to have two minutes   103423 am   mayor adler yes councilmember tovo makes that motion is there a second to that motion councilmember kitchen seconds that any discussion before we vote those in favor    tovo a little bit of discussion it looks like we have scattered  im not sure if youve done a count of how many people that would impact it looks like we have one person here one person there and if those folks are the same then those items dont get pulled from consent anyway   mayor adler it would be a little under 20 people would be given an additional minute   tovo that amounts to about  lets see  20 minutes you said 20 so it just adds about 20 minutes    mayor adler as a general rule as weve been doing it people would get one minute when we cross over 40 speakers but because the council wanted   103523 am  to give extra time to people on those two cases the vmu and the compatibility we had extended that to the two minutes so that added an additional minute for about half   tovo im trying to understand this choice    mayor adler this choice    tovo just adds 20 minutes to our day and when we have that conversation i think we need to revisit what our previous practice was i thought it was agenda item by agenda item that the first  it wasnt the first people who signed up for the day on any item on the agenda it was the first people who signed up on a particular agenda item got three minutes and then it got reduced is what i thought we did not if you sign  if we have a hundred people for number 1 and we have two people on 4 the two people on 4 always got their full time but we can go back and make sure that were remembering that correctly   mayor adler no    tovo what we see now is collapse everybody into one bucket rather than taking it   103623 am  item by item and our standing practice and policy was take it issue by issue and reduce within the agenda item   mayor adler you are correct the way we used to do it we had individual calls for each people could sign up while their item was being discussed we had people signing up to speak at 400 500 700 900 at night to speak each one was called individually we did do that  the policy had us with three minutes for the first 20 speakers and then one minute after the 20 speakers so the one minute was what we have in our rules our ordinances for speakers after the first 20 but the first 20 did get three minutes and thats how thats written that also had us in council meetings 800 900 1000 midnight which we heard from people was unfair to them   103726 am   tovo mayor that was individual item by individual item    mayor adler correct   tovo that is not the practice that were using at the moment and im saying i think our practice on the table  i think our practice in our adopted approved practices is not what weve been following   mayor adler correct   tovo what id like to suggest is that id like to add the additional context the change were contemplating is in line with our approved policies and it also adds just 20 minutes   mayor adler i disagree about the approved policies section because that has one minute but in any event the motion in front of us right now  approved policies is three minutes for the first 20 people and one minute thereafter   mayor i think that well be happy to discuss this at a work session we can talk about this all day long then what the actual procedures say   mayor adler okay so the motion in front of us is to give everybody this morning   103826 am  two minutes ready to take a vote those in favor of that change please raise your hand it passes with a majority vote so everybody this morning will get two minutes lets go ahead and call the first speaker were going to do the speakers in person first do them in order and please identify the item on which the person is testifying thank you   lauren stanley items 4 and 5 on deck gus pea   mayor while were waiting i just wanted to clarify that we got confirmation that it would be okay to authorize negotiation of item 10 but not execute so that they can finish negotiating the plan and then they can come back to us for approval on the plan   mayor adler so does that mean you dont need to pull it   it has to be pulled to be   103927 am  voted on with the other but when we do that i will motion to negotiate it rather than negotiate and execute so they can continue their process   mayor adler okay   im not anticipating a problem with the plan i just think    mayor adler please remember to raise that when we get to that item yes councilmember kitchen    kitchen so the item that the mayor pro tem is talking about thats  were going to discuss that right   mayor adler we have to because it cant be considered before item 81 which is the public hearing   kitchen okay thank you   mayor adler okay   gus pea speaking on items 9 27 39 45   lets get this together okay because its bad for the community over here and you think youre bewildered were more were over here   laughing    councilmember natasha thank you very much for saying hello that meant a lot to me okay   104028 am  item number 9 first of all i showed you when you were running for mayor i showed you my special  with the irs id okay its just discriminatory the way youre doing right now three minutes what where

39 on deck rebecca hibler   good morning councilmembers my name is kristen haney i am the chair of the east caesar chavez neighborhood land use committee im here to support item number 39 this project is located in a live work flex subdistrict and it is eligible for a density bonus this project is not eligible for a height bonus and it is not requesting additional height the maximum base building height is 40 feet the live work flex subdistrict imposes a minimum density of 17 dwelling units per acre   104333 am  and its primary intention is to function as a residential district with proximity to lowerdensity neighborhoods adjacent to the tod residential is a required use of this subdistrict and were very greatful that it is weve been dealing with a lot of rezoning projects coming in and asking for a lot more than this and not giving us any housing whatsoever so were excited to see housing come to the project the applicant is requesting roughly 25000 bonus square feet in exchange they are offering to provide onethird of the gross residential square footage as affordable units at 60 mfi and theyre offering to pay a fee in lieu for the entire bonus square footage area so we really appreciate the applicants intention to work within the saltillo tod regulating plan and to deliver a   104434 am   heightappropriate building that provides commerce residential and affordable residential to our neighborhood and we hope that you will join us in supporting this project thank you   rebecca hib ler ler on deck janis rankin janis rankin speaking on item 52 on deck joseph reynolds speaking on 52 as well   thank you councilmember tovo for pulling this item mr mayor and councilmembers i am janis rankin a constituent   104537 am  of councilmember pool in district 7 and you heard from me on the subject of the asmp predesignated rightofway at the council meeting on may 19th the allandale neighborhood association passed a resolution submitted to you on monday june 6th you should have a copy in your materials it requests the council to express its intent about the rightofway in an ordinance this could be added as a new subparagraph e which is in the remarks that i submitted to you in writing through the city clerk and that you could be able to  i think adopt pretty easily the purpose of it would be for the council to declare as an act of good faith and fair dealing that the asmp street network amendments will not impair or affect the use or purpose of ownership rights of the private real properties affected outside the agreed dedication city procedures and the additional predesignated rightofway suggestions will not be used or invoked as a basis for claiming taking or   104639 am  acquiring these property rights without following proper notice bona fide offer and other procedures under chapter 21 of the texas property code notice and protest procedures of chapter 211 of the texas local government code and other app applicable state laws this additional paragraph which is short would verify statements made by city staff and some councilmembers in public meetings and create an official document filed in the city records by the city clerk making it accessible to the public this additional short paragraph would protect the interests of your constituents who live and work here raise families here do good works and community services here pay property taxes here and vote here please do this   mayor adler thank you   buzzer sounding    joseph reynolds speaking on 52 on deck roy wayley also on 52   104747 am    mayor and council im joe reynolds i live on west 49th street im here to urge you to reject the asmp update theres been improper planning there are two defect types in this planning first a failure of scope to consider and document either property of character or the propertys relevant physical and environmental limitations second the failure of process and that is not writing in the restrictions for using a rightofway which were promised in hearings but not in the document janis just addressed that for you the first class of failures is enhanced when you approve the plan at that point possible defects are ignored the plan becomes 100 okay its councilapproved that happened with the trail plan downtown to the domain like asmp it failed to consider environmental limitations a contract was left to construct the pathway that assumed no limitations to building   104847 am  the geology of shoal creek was ignored construction disturbed the hillside and the resulting collapse has a cost approaching 20 million by handout i included one example of a similar future asmp incident it can result in apartments sliding into barton springs road at lamar no the engineer wont identify and correct the problem any more than the engineer for the trail they will be focused on the roadway not the cut needed to build it and there will be other examples youll hear about when the local news interviews you plans must be more than desires and objectives they must include limitations and logistics after asmp discussed excessive rightofway there was widespread alarm with flags stuck in yards to show the extent staff repeatedly voiced assurances that the homeowners would not be affected but refused to write the voiced limitations into the plan theres no trust with staff the lastminute red line changes to the plan after all hearings and possible citizen comment   104949 am  enhanced the depth   buzzer sounding    you have a duty to reject it as presented until those defects are addressed thank you   roy wayley speaking on item 52 on deck jeffrey bowen   howdy yall roy wayley i am the chair of the austin regional group of the sierra club conservation committee and i wont take much time this has already been talked about its already been decided i dont know why its back how many times do you get to bite the apple until you get what you want vote no reject this its easy youve already done it once its easy to do it again please do thank you   mayor i just need  roy   mayor adler mr wayley    tovo roy what specifically i missed what you wanted us to   105049 am  reject   pardon me   tovo what were you urging us to reject   on 52   tovo the entire 52 or a specific element of it   well specifically on 52 my concerns would be the effect it would have on mopac   tovo are you talking about the inclusion of sh45 extension   yes   tovo theres a lot    yall have gone over there its been decided i dont know why its coming back   tovo i understand   if we do that its going to put such pressure on mopac weve already got 130 thats being underutilized because of the tolls weve got the trucks that are just jamming up i35   tovo okay thank you roy   thats going to happen on mopac and that was never part of the plan mopac was supposed to be an inner city boulevard 130 is supposed to do that 360 is supposed to do that back in 1980 620 was supposed to be the outer loop   105151 am   tovo i dont mean to stop you i appreciate this i have an amendment coming forward to address that i didnt hear you talk about sh45 so i wasnt sure if you were talking about the entire asmp   im sorry   tovo i wanted to be clear on which piece you were objecting to thank you very much   mayor adler thank you very much thank you thank you sir   tovo the problematic part okay thanks    jeffrey bowen speaking on 52 and 66 on deck zachary   good morning my name is jeffrey district 8 here on the asmp there appears to be many undisclosed amendments according to the cover of the red line asmp it states it has been amended as of today yet here we are with item 52 on the agenda theres no mention of the 1407page document and the backups regarding the city blocks affected by the   105253 am  expansion this was provided by the asmp team to many in the public 20 blocks per page over 28000 blocks affected if you estimate six properties per block that brings out total number to just under 169000 properties and that numbers probably low that information was provided by the asmp team and should be in the backup its called transparency how many were notified of these eventual changes where are the good faith fair dealings and most of all good governance in a recent tcm training session this past week the tcm was referred to as  the asmp is referred to as the guiding document whereas the asmp refers to the tcm as the guiding document which is it this isnt good governance the change in the ordinance that   105356 am  gives the city traffic engineer authority to make certain operational changes within the rightofway this is reshaping land use why not say what it is its a backdoor to taking private property from a new development do we need to be reminded of past court rulings it is state that had the public was provided numerous opportunities to comment on this amendment what good is public input when cole kitten states at the austin planning commission    buzzer sounding    that the public comments were taken with a grain of salt where are good faith fair dealings transparency and good governance from our elected officials   applause    thank you   mayor adler thank you next speaker   zachary faddes speaking on items 66 and 80 on deck carmen pulido   105502 am    carmen llanes on deck monica guzman   good morning ill try to stay diplomatic but i am wondering where the government that works for all section went in strategic direction 2023 its pretty tough to keep up with yall right now you will see a statement from del valle community coalition and go austinvamos austin if you havent already related to item 80 vmu please pay attention to that statement the reason we wrote it is because we are in relationship with the people directly impacted negatively by speculation upzoning and other real estate practices that unregulated or deregulated uproot and disrupt the lives businesses and caretakers networks in our city they damage our environment they displace transit riders and they give us more expensive problems that you then talk about how to allocate our limited tax dollars to solve   105603 am  you give this gift to developers if you deregulate vmu if you get rid of compatibility if you give by right entitlements we lose the public process that allows us to negotiate better deals youve created a land acquisition fund from project connect dollars youve created a community initiated solutions fund were trying to failure out how the hell to get to people youve got a tenant relocation fund with no money in it these are the solutions that are presented at planning commission and in front of you to make a case for these upzonings as if the harm is mitigated it is not people are being harmed if you make blanket changes like this we lose the public process to negotiate to use those funds youve worked so hard to allocate for us we can come up with better deals that produce more housing preserve affordability and keep regular austinites from being displaced i also just want to say that if you do this with the compatibility all of these confusing things about the asmp youre asking for lawsuits why do we have to sue the city   105705 am  of austin to guarantee our public process we shouldnt have to do that every time and we shouldnt hear excuses about how youre worried about violating fair housing if we look at area mfi so we can equitably upzone but youre willing to challenge state law on our public process and notification please give us a chance to actually work out some better land deals and produce housing in a way thats less harmful and please this afternoon give those clayton lane residents their full two or three minutes because the case youre discussing determines where whether and how they are displaced the least you can do is let them tell their story up here thank you   buzzer sounding    cheering and applause    mayor adler thank you next speaker    monica guzman speaking on items 66 69 80 on deck mario cantu   good morning im policy director of gave and a district 4 resident gava is opposed to items 66 and 80 i want to reference the del   105806 am  valle community coalition gave joint statement regarding the affordability level of affordable units required by vmu two they should be tied to 60 of the travis county mfi or 80 mfi for the census tract if block group data is not available that the parcel is on whichever is lower this defines affordability based on what is affordable to the neighborhood and takes into account equity issues it achieves when vmu two is used in an area in which the mfi is lower than the travis countywide one any housing will be affordable to the existing residents of the neighborhood this mitigates impact to displacement and ensuring existing residents can continue to afford their neighborhood affordable housing will be included in higher income neighborhoods at a rate that is more affordable than current units when units are built in a neighborhood that are affordable based on travis county but not local affordability these units contribute to gentrification and displacement in the neighborhood this will mitigate that impact the relocation benefits must be   105908 am  strengthened given the tenant relocation ordinance and potentially unfunded relocation fund are insufficient to prevent the risk of displacement and homelessness vmu two developers must provide a package of financial benefits to renters impacted by displacement when the old homestead renters requested a package from the developer the developer directed them to the tro and told them the city would take care of their relocation expenses my closing comments are as a d4 resident i remember hearing discussion about postponing this to engage the community may 16th was the south austin community meeting but residents in the remaining six districts including 1 and 4 in the eastern crescent are still waiting when will you schedule the meeting for authentic engagement especially with multilingual lowincome and workingclass communities   buzzer sounding    please do right by your constituents go back and watch and listen to the testimony by people of color on may the 19th thank you   applause    mayor adler thank   110009 am    mario cantu speaking on item 52 and 80 on deck fred fletcher   good evening councilmembers mario cantu i wanted to speak on item 52 its my understanding that there was a lot of conversation maybe a lot of promises that were made on that particular item and if there was promises that were made to the residents to citizens here in austin texas then those items need to be in writing and they need to be followed if thats not the case then there needs to be a lot more conversation regarding this item and making sure that everything is complete and in writing for the residents of that area on item 80 the vmu2 as you   110109 am  know i was here like about three weeks ago speaking on vmu2 and this conversation that i had with each one of yall present the main thing that i spoke about was displacement we have that situation that i spoke about right now going on with these individuals in item 120 the scenario that i gave is exactly whats taking place right now and in this apartment complex theres three  my understanding there is three veterans that are there are we going to stick those veterans back down under ben white boulevard after this was done you know the goal was from the very beginning and i know mayor adler had worked on this is to pull veterans off of the street and to keep them off the street but we still have veterans that are on the street and we still have them potentially going on the street aside from that veterans   110210 am  alone what if were pulling healthcare workers what if were pulling paramedics pulling ents or residents alone that live here at a lower mmi we need to work on the purpose of making sure that these individuals when this scenario and this situation takes place in this city we find a way to shift these individuals   buzzer sounding  in better housing either equal or greater at the mmf that they were at thank you   mayor adler thank you   applause    speaking on item 57 58 fred fletcher on deck lisa fletcher   edgar handel   is it item 68 speaking   yes    okay im candace fulls and i am   110311 am  vice president of the austin history center association board and im here to speak in support of item number 68 and i wanted to thank councilmember leslie pool and her aids louisa  s maid for shepparding this resolution from the travis county commissioners to our council i wanted to thank councilmember cathy tovo including deflecting efforts by other councilmembers to dedicate space for nonarchival nonlibrary city purposes for sponsoring city council action to increase 2018 bond funding for the austin history center buildings and for being a longtime austin history center association member and supporter of its activities and events thank you leslie and kathy   110412 am  thank you   mayor adler thank you   edgar handel speaking on items 59 62 and 80 on deck luke metzger   id like to say im strongly in favor of item 86 concerning urban renewal for eleventh and 12th streets austin resident who spends a lot of time on these corridors im glad to see work to breathe new life into this entertainment district i also strongly approve of changes to make ads easier to build i would not have been able to afford my home if i did not share the lot with an adu on item 66 and 80 concerning housing on corridor while i appreciate the efforts to alleviate the housing crisis we should make the most of this opportunity its painfully clear that detached homes in austin are attainable only for the rich building homes for the   110514 am  average household means building multifamily housing sadly we seem to be held back in a part by an idea that multifamily housing is incompatible with families im a second generation honduran immigrant and we were raised for many years in apartments and at times our families were dependent on public transit apartments arent something that needs to be kept from other homes they provide opportunity to working class families so i ask council to build abundant housing on our corridors to eliminate parking and compatibility requirements that prevent more homes for families like mine thank you   edgar edgar one minute may i have a quick question for the     mayor adler go ahead yes   edgar im an immigration attorney represented many many clients many of whom live in district 4 large families the vast majority of my clients working class families lived in apartments with their families   110614 am  is that  i know thats your personal experience but in terms of like the folks that you grew up with is that what you see around you   yeah i mean growing up it was my whole extended family i mean i had aunts uncles grandparents cousins lived with their families in apartments families even across the us and california i mean its just even today we still have family and family friends many of whom are immigrant families too who are living in apartments and raising children i mean i  i think in many ways maybe a more normal thing for immigrant families maybe  i dont know why might be specific to them i really think its a thing for all families but thats at least my experience   i just wanted to say i appreciated your comments i understand a lot of folks you know think of kind of the house you know and when we have kids were going to buy a home but that is largely unavailable for huge swaths of our   110716 am  population and i just want it not to be something extraordinary a normal thing for families to live in apartments and grow up in apartments i appreciate your input   all right thank you   mayor adler thank you next speaker   luke metzger speaking on item 61 on deck blythe randolph   good morning luke metzger with environment texas as austin grows were paving over more and morph 0 our natural areas since 1997 weve lost about 30 of our open space in travis county in a twoyear period we lost 6 of our tree canopy and as we pave over more and more that causes significant environmental problems including water pollution flooding urban heat island effect on water pollution we know that when it rains it doesnt absorb into the ground when people swim in our creeks they can get sick recent study found that 57 million americans get   110817 am   water borne illnesses from swimming in creeks lakes ocean eye infection skin rashes ear infection and other problems we know flooding is a serious problem here in central texas we have more flooding related deaths than any other part of the country aside from houston in central texas and flooding is only going to get worse with climate change and finally urban heat island effect with more and more concrete just making it hotter and hotter in our cities which makes it more miserable this time of year and also deadly for people who have to work outside so as we densify and we do need to densify because sprawl is perhaps our biggest environmental crisis as we densify we need to make sure were mitigating some of those impacts and item 61 is a critical measure to help make sure we reduce the impacts of storm water runoff help cleanup our creeks help reduce flooding add more nature to our cities so that we can have both a natural and city and a healthier water so thank you so much   110917 am     applause    mayor adler mr metzger before you take off on the environmental ordinance there was some question with respect to green field and slope we obviously wanted  we want to have green field development and the question becomes difficult is if you already have a track that is 100 impervious cover how do you actually incent them to redevelop that track if the rules in place would take away too much of the property to allow for that incent we prepared an amendment with others colleagues councilmember harper madison councilmember ellis to say lets figure out the best way from an environmental standpoint to actually make sure these protections come in place and then councilmember tovo you had asked yesterday weve limited that just to the slope and the green   111018 am  field language and i think weve worked on that language with you and your group is that language that you support   yeah i think it makes sense to take a little bit of extra time i think the city staff are doing to need that time to actually develop the rule and it is important that we get it right because we do want to make sure that we are encouraging infill development not sprawl but at the same time working to make sure that were reducing that runoff pollution   mayor adler great thank you very much okay next speaker   blythe randolph speaking on 61 on deck roy waley    stewart carr speaking on 62 on deck taylor jackson   111127 am  taylor jackson speaking on item 62 on deck jc dwyer   mayor mayor pro tem councilmembers my name is taylor jackson im the ceo for the home builders association of greater austin speaking in support of item 62 focused on helping the construction of accessory dwelling units ads on behalf of our members key elements for consideration yesterday as we move forward flexibility and adu construction is a starting point working toward a solution to a very complex issue with the goal for the city to add 135000 housing units within a ten year period although it will not solve our housing supply alone ads do provide housing option and housing option excuse me to residents even potential rent revenue   111227 am  helping our growing population to stay in their homes and neighborhoods whether its to help their families or age in place thank you to councilmembers kelly harpermadison vela kitchen ellis and mayor pro tem with your amendment and of course your staff members for your collaboration with the home builders association our organizations vision is to build communities that enable people to thrive and grow collectively we must continue to be diligent and persistent to solve for housing my staff member hba staff member david glen board president scott and i welcome the continued collaboration in this effort thank you for your time   thank you   jc dwyer speaking on item 66 on deck brittney paxman   i think mr waley might   111327 am  have been skipped over the person who was ahead of him didnt come to the podium then he was on deck but then we kept going    mayor adler mr waley has already spoken   he spoke earlier we had him twice on the list   okay thank you    mayor adler next speaker   brittney paxman speaking on 66 on deck weiss asar   hello council my name is brittney paxman im a single family homeowner in district one i also just started by own small business a year ago and im here to speak about 66ola buenos diaz   speaking in spanish  my grandparents lived on loyola lane i hope i said 70s correctly i want to make a couple of   111428 am  points i think the first  the best time to build more and develop was 30 years ago the second best time is now and i really like us to be different and welcoming of new austinites i think some of us who have lived here a long time think we are entitled to live in houses or we are entitled to not welcome new people i fully reject that we should be a community that welcomes new austinites wherever they come from i also lived in an apartment then i lived in a condo in councilmember renterias district i moved across the street and bought a house in district 1 on ninth street that was all possible because we had dense housing on the east side and im eternally grateful for that and i hope we can create that type of opportunity for more and more austinites i also want to say to folks who might sue the city or things like that i ask people to reconsider i do really want to hear specifically from the earlier speakers they said   111529 am  some things i hadnt considered and i certainly especially as a white woman dont know all of the ins and outs of this so im really open to being persuaded but my perspective right now is that we need more housing we need to build higher we need to build closer to single family home im here to say yes in my back yard build apartments next door to me build condos make it so that people can live in my community thank you   buzzer sounding    cheering and applause    asar speaking on 66 and 80 on deck daniel cableman   good morning mayor mayor pro tem councilmembers my name is asar and i serve on the board of housing works austin thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak today to you affordable housing and other housing related issues in our april letter to yall housing works austin expressed its support for    111631 am  creating a vmu2 program while also addressing the issues of compatibility and parking asking you to modify and eliminate parking where possible with an effort to increase our affordable housing capacity we thank council for their efforts to increase austins affordable housing by program linking housing to transit and creating more opportunities for tenants to have protections in this housing we thank you all for your leadership when expanding housing opportunities including affordable housing opportunities throughout our city and particularly working on item 66 and 80 while council has taken important steps address the impact of compatibility and parking requirements on housing there is much more work left to be done both in the present and in the future we hope that we can work next year and beyond to further support housing and building out more affordable housing opportunities in our city by buy right development center programming and tackling compatibility and parking   111732 am  requirements on item 61 we hope that council can ensure that any impact on housing capacity is minimized while addressing critical environmental issues this is a great opportunity for us to support both our affordable housing and housing goals along with our environmental goals as a community i thank the mayors efforts to ensure that any unintended consequences of this item are minimized while ensuring the maximum environmental benefit for our community thank you all for your efforts and lastly on a personal note i just want to say im very excited to see that confederate street is set to be renamed being from that part of the city i walk on confederate street every day im excited from now on i will walk on maggie may street   daniel cableman on deck david anderson   mayor adler mayor pro tem alter councilmembers thank you for the opportunity to speak im a pro housing advocate   111832 am  today you have some choices to make about how we allocate the scarce land in the city these allocations represent the priorities of the city the current land development code prioritizes the protection of single family homes and the people in them to make a gross generalization those in single family homes in austin represent in aggregate a privileged minority land use and zoning regulations have a very dark past if we continue to cling to the vestiges of an inequitable and immoral system of land use regulation the city of austin makes a single and profound statement you are not welcome here so today as you consider a few land use reform items in front of you make a brave and necessary choice use the power vested in you by the people of austin to choose to allow more people  to live here the overly restricted land use regulations have created an affordability crisis they are contributing to the climate crisis they are perpetuating profound inequities among   111932 am  the people of austin and the displacement that everyone is so worried about is occurring under the current code so thank you for bringing these items forward and attempting to make some changes that will allow for the construction of homes for the residents of this city however you can and should and must make further changes to these items including further relaxation of compatibility the total elimination of parking mandates and buy right development to show us today that you are all indeed serious about addressing the housing crisis that we are facing im not going to stand here and cite the numerous studies that show that relaxes land use regulation leads to more abundant housing for all residents they will always be there for you to read and to learn from theres not really any serious debate about why american cities find themselves in that cricies you all know why you have the power to use this information to create the policies that will lead to affordable sustainable and equitable development so please be brave be bold and dont let the threat of a lawsuit from a   112033 am  disgruntled minority scare you from doing the right thing help your constituents and make these urgent reforms to the code thank you   thank you   david anderson speaking on 78 on deck craig neeser   mayor pro tem councilmembers i believe 78 has been pulled i also end up on 79  postponed to july 28th i also signed up on 79 im here representing the applicant and available for questions if you have any thank you   thank you item 61 craig neeser on deck greg anderson   112135 am   mayor and council so thank you all for taking up item 66 and 80 nothing costs us more housing units in the city than compatibility its almost like we hear that over and over again the great thing is were all talking about it right so where and when we find the leadership to finally do away it maybe its now maybe its not now the longer we wait the more people who are hurt by it right next slide please so compatibility in a nutshell pretend the far right is amazing transit corridor 7th street  airport you name it and then theres bills house on the left and this development now has how many units lost because of compatibility next slide please so all of these units  next slide are vacant because we werent allowed to build them because of compatibility next slide so if bills house costs 2 million and all this land available to have an amazing density bonus program that could have yielded a tremendous amount of housing on transit on our most   112237 am  walkable transit you know invested corridors we dont let them get built because its more important to protect the multimillion dollars home from change than it is to legalize a tremendous amount of housing in the city so when do we get the leadership to finally say we are beyond compatibility maybe it made sense in 1984 when all we were looking to do is build sprawl but now were not looking to do that were looking to build more compact and connected more responsibly were not allowed to do that under outdated rules such as compatibility next slide please last thing actually i have one more after this its also important that we calibrate it correctly staff is recommending a 20 jump and were all going down to below 60 80 for rental if we arbitrarily say 50 that could cost us a tremendous amount of units i already had a couple of people reach out to me that are like look capital these monies that build these project if were going to kill the deal by taking too much value that money will go elsewhere   112338 am  so those homes never get built last slide while you guys are looking at item 61 please be considerate of the fact that it will cost us a lot of housing cost a lot of money if we dont take care of this one item thank you   craig neeser on item 61 on deck solvaypraxis   hello austin city council im craig neese reinvestment im the conservation chair of the lone star chapter of the sierra club back in the early teens i went to a whole series of watershed meetings that were some of the best meetings ive ever been to where almost all the stuff in item 61 was covered we had developers there we had environmentalists there they were fantastic meeting talked about incorporated in my yard in my house this is really good stuff and i just want to say that its not true that we either do density or either we   112438 am  protect our city from flooding and water problems that is not true first of all water is going to flow whether you have density or not its just a reality of nature and you have to account for it if you dont  want people flooded and down the creek and people damaged and people killed so i also think that if you build density without close by parkland from what ive seen living in manhattan island for years is you build the ghettos of the future people dont want to live too far away from some kind of natural environment so the idea of maybe taking some parts of 100 impervious cover and creating a little bit more park land is going to make a more liveable more sustainable city into the future and more equitable it will make things more equitable i know this is the long view   112538 am  this isnt the short view we have to have the long view in my opinion so please i want to see a strong watershed ordinance as we get on this stuff this is good stuff here thank you very much   applause    speaking on item 80 on deck curtis rogers   all right good morning mayor and council my name is solve a y rosa today im here on behalf of the del valle coalition we have shared a joint statement with council in which we ask you to do a deeper dive into the impacts of the vmu program in regard displacement issues prior to adopting this resolution our concerns that equity issues for residents at risk of displacement who are disproportionately black and brown and in the eastern crescent have not been investigated we know this resolution has been in the pipeline for a long time but the stakes are too high for residents facing displacement and the fact that the city has had so long to do such a study and has not done so is   112641 am  alarming you will be hearing from renters later today whose experiences can be viewed as a case study in the unintended consequences and perverse incentives created by vmu with the destruction of naturally occurring deeply affordable units and displacement of working class residents between ten and 40 mfi including latinx immigrant families and veterans pending the row zoning case the property will be sold to the developer and demolished for a vmu development in which even the affordable units at 60 mfi are unaffordable to existing residents we ask that council direct staff to investigate the affordability units and number of unions lost by vmu and the pro mostly sunnied vmu two as well as impacts on residents displaced by such rezoning finally please review or several recommendations that we believe will somewhat mitigate displacement should council move ahead despite our significant concerns firstly we recommend that the affordability level required by vmu2 tied to whichever is lower of the   112742 am   following option either 60 of the travis county as proposed in the current resolution or 80 of the neighborhood mfi which can be determined by census block group or census tract if block group data is not available this would mean affordable housing produced by vmu will be available to residents and residents will continue to afford their neighborhood   mayor adler thank you    mayor adler councilmember kitchen   kitchen did you complete your list of recommendations   no there were actually two more recommendations   kitchen id like to hear them   absoluteliment one is that we recommend that a study be done with residents who have been displaced by redevelopments and different scenarios for the compensation to prevent homelessness and displacement for them and this should also review the current tenant relocation ordinance which is weak and the tenant relocation fund which is unfunded   112843 am  and our third recommendation was to basically preserve compatibility requirements especially for working class bipoc neighborhoods vulnerable to and experience is active or chronic gentrification we believe that these requirements ensure that developers communicate with local residents regarding the proposed changes and negotiate for community benefits giving that away gives away the tool for communities to negotiate community benefits   kitchen thank you   mayor i wanted to flag for staff when we consider item 80 if we could have staff share an update on the tenant relocation fund councilmember tovo i believe you asked a question during our budget process about the tenant relocation fund and i was under the impression that there was funding in that fund i would like to see if staff could be able to speak to that later today   tovo i think it may be a couple of different things one is that we have put in money for  yeah if the staff could come back that would be great   112944 am  i think we put money into tenant relocation and tenant advocacy in response to some resolutions that i and others have brought and then i believe we were moving forward with a nexus study we had money for a nexus study and thats the subject of where it got lost but that is the next step thanks for  mentioning that that we have a series of budget questions trying to figure out how to move that work forward and what happened to the money that we had   mayor adler council member vela   vela we in response to a couple of situations right now in district 4 weve been looking at both the rules around the tenant relocation and the fund and my office did confirm that there is zero dollars in the tenant relocation assistance fund so thats where we are we were trying to get folks some relocation assistance but we were advised that   113045 am  there is zero dollars right now and there is no process to fund it and again ill let staff speak to this in the future but theres also i think that there are substantial both kind of administrative and legal concerns with the fees that were set out in it so anyway i think weve got a hill to climb with regard to tenant relocation attendance   mayor adler morgan i think we  ms morgan i think we should put on executive session the question of legal issues related to that fund so we can have that conversation   vela i would appreciate that   kitchen yes i would too   mayor adler all right next speaker   speaking on item 80 curtis rogers on deck jake murdock   good morning mayor and council members my name isur cis and im a resident of district 3 last time i was here i read a list of 19 american cities that no longer had a parking ratio for their homes and businesses but i failed to mention what happened after these rules were changed   113146 am  not much not much changes immediately this is a reform that drastically changes many things overnight minneapolis has had a few things jason whit enburg said that for site constraints reasons and economic reasons it would have been hard to park these buildings at one parking space per unit he said were clearly seeing that making a significant difference similar to all of these cities downtown austin has no parking rules yet we still have parking and almost all new buildings are continuing to build parking this change would simply give austin the ability to evolve as transportation changes as project connect comes online as the electric bikes become more mainstream and as we improve our infrastructure for pedestrians wheelchairs and bikes the reality is this is not much of a change for us as it is for the next    113247 am  generation last would be 107 degrees this weekend and i think allowing more  we should allow more parking but we shouldnt mandate it we shouldnt be putting more asphalt and more concrete in austin as a mandate thank you   my name is jake murdock im a renter in district 3 and i would like to stay in austin i love austin but we need more housing so i ask that we please update the rules to allow for more housing and stop requiring so much parking   mayor adler thank you   augiestrock up next paul   my name is augie im a renter and a teacher ive already been displaced   113347 am  this year because of rent increases and im worried that it is going to continue and i feel like more vertical integrated housing is going to be the only solution to allowing more affordable housing in austin teaching is a love of mine and a passion but i find my selves at a crossroads of whether or not i can continue to do my passion in austin still   thank you   paul saldana speaking on item 123   mayor adler next speaker   zenobia joseph moving on to remote speakers ana aguirre   113451 am  ana aguirre   indiscernible   go ahead   hello can you hear me   yes    hello okay great good morning mayor and council members my name is ana and i currently serve on the environmental commission ive the indiscernible of the contact team and the president of the austin neighborhoods council today im speaking only for myself since i am speaking on items 39 52 66 61 69 and 80 i support the staff recommendation on item 39 i indiscernible item 52 for reasons previously stated i support item 61 and support on may the 18th i support item 69 because there are so many areas throughout the city that do not have a plan working with residents who truly know what is working and needed enhances their overall quality of life i hope that you will honor the plans proposed by this resolution as there has been instances in which the current plans and valid   113552 am  petitions are not honored even after residents negotiation attempt to work with the developers fall apart the proposed agreement regarding community engagement with have no teeth when residents with subsequent plan amendments are not honored as has been experienced with residents under current plans i am opposed to items 86 and 80  indiscernible this proposal would have on vulnerable communities particularly the areas within the eastern crescent careful consideration regarding the potential displacement and gentrification of residents along the current and proposed vmu areas has not taken place this concern is being demonstrated by item 120 on todays agenda i support the old homestead renters association and their efforts to not displace current residents if these residents are forced to become homeless then that would be a clear indication of what the rest of us can expect if item 66 and 80 are approved people cant see that theyre working towards mitigating homelessness and   113653 am  at a time add to the homeless population again why hasnt the equity office been consulted and how about the project connect equity tool factor into this thank you for your consideration and service to our community  buzzer   paula kaufmann speaking on item 39   hello yes the south river city citizens approved this statement regarding land use labor day 2019 quote affordability we believe that austin needs more affordable housing  indiscernible as numerous affordable units and older homes ads and multifamily homes today however we disagree with feeinlieu alternative for developers who receive greater entitlements in exchange for community    113757 am  benefits there should be onsite affordable comments unquote my own comments is it economically feasible to build onsite is unfair to the rest of austin you can build to the current height and density and yet services significantly increases cost experts have testified that feeinlieu rarely produces more affordable housing it could be built on cheaper lots if not logical when you first buy the lot feeinlieu rates do not core the glut the argument that poor people want to live where theyre comfortable defies austins goals of putting workers near employers let the builders build on their land it not a mandate its a negotiation if they dont want to build affordable housing they can build to the current restriction its on the ownerrer to verify annually that the residents meet the affordability requirements and have the owners cover the hoa fees for the lower income residents otherwise   113858 am  they can build to current code and speaking on items 102 and 103 its outrageous how much pressure council expects academy drive and surrounding neighborhoods to endure this used to be 15 acres with a parking lot i have walked from the parking garage at music lane to this venue its a long ways this owner has never tried to help he has a big empty parking lot that he charges for so one of the council members says that its cleaner to have   buzzer  15000 square feet for music venues but ive driven her district its clean because no one parks on the street why should she give district 9 a poor quality of life while her constituents live in peace in their gated communities so  and also i went to the place the owner says that they cant move the stage the stage isnt there now so its not forthcoming   thank you speaker your   114003 am  time has expired   the owner of the property husband compromise   mayor adler thank you   william bunch item 52 and 80   yes good afternoon mayor and council members thank you all for your service to our community on item 52 i want to ask that you please remove the extension of sh 45 southwest over to i35 from the document you should have all received a letter from me about this on behalf of save our springs alliance a very much appreciate councilmember tovos taking that off of consent i recognize that some  time back this stretch of highway was included apparently in the citys plan but that was before it was taken out   114104 am  of the campo regional plan it was also done in conflict with direct city council policy against this roadway and as your backup shows very clearly all of the public outreach this time around did not show that road in the plan it was using the campo materials for that backup if you build this road if you support its building youre basically supporting the conversion of mopac from a local commuter highway into an inner regional and interstate alternative for i35 for trucks and cars txdots told us we cant ban trucks on mopac if we make this link and so whereas we have almost no truck traffic including trucks hauling toxic materials on mopac if this gets done thats what we have this should not be done by   114206 am  staff in direct violation of council policy and through the back door and basically secretly if youre going to do this lets do it open and honestly through a real public process so thank you so much this should be a very simple essentially a correction to the 300 page document that you have in front of you as the strategic mobility plan   mayor adler thank you   thank you   natalie friendsly item 52 and 66   good morning im natalie and i live in d7 and am a the city of councilmember pool today im speaking for myself im asking regarding item 52 for council to write formally into the asmp ordinance what council members ellis tovo and others as well as city staff members kidman spillar have stated in public   114306 am  recorded meetings ms janis register enspoke earlier about proposed wording that the alan dale neighborhood association incorporated into their document i urge you to adopt this wording this council has followed public input procedures that are contrary to austins culture of inclusive municipal participation we must mandate public access to information and time to deliberate it only two days ago a council member posted amendments to relax parking requirements arent schools this is a major  change not a minor edit of the earlier posted draft resolution how much time will you give the public to consider this only two days ago another council member posted graphics for arguments about corridor density on the council message board how much time will you give the public to consider this   114407 am  new information there has been no widely publicized town hall or other organized mass events for the greater public to find out about affordability projections impact and evaluation procedures driving this specific resolution as carmen llanespulido said earlier this morning its hard to keep up with you on land use as ms preas said earlier this morning the city has not provided a deep dive to the displacement impact of vmu compatibility and parking relaxing changes austinites deserve better than merely reacting to policy positions posted at the last minute  buzzer please repair the harm to good governance by giving all austinites deep complete and validated information and the time to deliberate it thank you for your time thank you for your service   mayor adler thank you   megan masonbach item 62   114513 am  66 82 and 80   this is megan and thank you council for hearing what i have to say today im concerned about the asmp be a change in land use for the future i understand but still for the 28000 blocks that have been listed in the asmp project those residents have no idea that in the future if they change their zoning that many feet will be taken from the front of their property to be used differently so its a land use change and i object to it for those reasons for the other items i think that relaxing parking and compatibility is really a bad idea it especially affects the eastern crescent with their ability to negotiate with   114614 am  developers and get a more equitable plan i think thats all im going to say today but weve had a wonderful lot of speakers 31 higher building rate in austin than anywhere else were doing really well with our building i dont think we have to change these rules we need parking for ads thank you for your time have a good day   chip harris item 66    mayor and council members my name is chip harris our taller buildings promise some benefits they also come with their own set of issues here are a couple of points illustrating these issues and arguing for buildings five stories or less   114714 am  urban planning expert michael buckston has stated quote what hirise does is separate large numbers of people from the street so what we end up with the city is detached from street life we end up with a city that is based on enclaves and gated communities end quote according to suzanne leonard cofounder and director of making cities liveable international council tall buildings off increased profits for developers however the higher a building rises the more expensive is the construction therefore the tallest buildings tend to be luxury units tall buildings inflate the price of the adjacent land thus making buildings and affordable housing less achievable in this way they actually increase inequality thank you for the   114815 am  opportunity to speak   david king item 69 and 80   thank you can you hear me   yes   thank you my name is david king and im speaking on items 69 and 80 69 district level planning for imagine austin activity centers and corridors please direct the city manager to reserve and distribute at least 10 of the citys annual budget for displacement prevention financial support directly to low and middle income renters and homeowners and small communitybased businesses located in or near planning districts and planning areas for project connect transit oriented development and imagine austin activity centers and corridors item 80 vertical mixed use zoning code amendment please stop driving wedges between homeowners and renters in order to facilitate land   114916 am  development projects that displace low and middle income renters and homeowners and small communitybased businesses to clear the decks for wealthy and high income families and their high end businesses please see concerns expressed by the anc president that taller and likely more expensive vmu developments could further drive up property taxes in nearby neighborhoods who renters and  homeowners are struggling to stay in their apartments and homes the increased height will impact the value of surrounding property again another way that were going to be displaced aguirre said she recommends that future vmu projects require individual approval by the city to lieu for community input i implore council to comply with the state laws regarding public notice public notice and protest rights for zoning changes compatibility should not be waived or reduced by right as it will facilitate rapid inflation in property values and property taxes on properties on or adjacent to corridors there by increasing displacement pressures on low and middle   115017 am  income renters and homeowners and small communitybased businesses parking requirements should not be waived or reduced by right in areas experiencing overflow parking in commercial uses  buzzer chronic safety issues inadequate infrastructure or involuntary displacement of low and middle income renters and homeowners and small communitybased businesses please implement the vmu recommendations expressed earlier by carmen llanespulido monica guzman and silva indiscernible   thank you speaker your time has expired   scott turner item 61 62 and 69   good morning mayor and council ill speak on item 61 first as a green builder im all for environmental stewardship new developments always provide more environmental benefits than what was there before this is not only because i choose to participate in the austin energy green builder   115118 am  program but also because of code requirements like the ones in this resolution i was glad to see the amendment regarding green fill retention however because its already hard enough to develop smaller tracts for housing much less than doubling or tripling the green field size that would be another barrier that would keep most tracts on corridors as car lots or strip centers and leave us with little or no new housing and new of the environmental benefits that come with with it many of the proposals in this resolution were included in the ldc rewrite but the goal was there was to help the environment and increase the housing supply that was a winwin and that is not in this resolution but it should be we can achieve that goal but we have to approach this holistically the way we did with the ldc for item number 69 i agree we need an update on the planning process and one that is actually accountable for meeting the citys goals and most of its residents the majority of which are underrepresented in planning efforts for example the word tenant is not even included in the resolution yet they are the   115219 am   majority of austinites the current planning process is dominated by people who have time to come to planning sessions and know how oh influence the outcome and this is reflected in the citys own study without requiring an equitable and accountable planning process this resolution will process the same inequitable neighborhood planning outcomes that had has for many years and still does today which is little or no plans for more housing please make housing the top priority in any planning process or the city will forever be unaffordable for most of its residents just like it is today thank you very much   ryan johnson items 62 and 69   yes hi this is ryan johnson im here as a lifelong resident of district 10 and urban planning professional and a former city staff member while i do support these efforts due to updates our   115320 am  city code is better than nothing im concerned that they wont make a meaningful dent in our housing prices and that they will actually burden services  indiscernible some people today have talked about the value of public process which is important but its also abused disingenuous byebye those very same people to fight against the only intervention that will prevent displacement in the longterm building more housing in short ive lived in austin my entire life i love it here i want to buy a home not necessarily a house here one day but unless you finally enact real reforms and allow a variety of housing everywhere in town i will never be able to that just makes me profoundly sad thank you   andy mckenna speaking on   115422 am  item 8 and 80   hello i am with the old homestead renters association i am i am speaking for myself but some that others may agree with when i learned of this proposal to make vmu 2 a lot easier for developers to kind of run roughshod over the process of notifying tenants i had to talk about how i didnt even hear about the process where im living because of the utility bill situation i dont yet a utility bill it comes in with my rent i had to go to planning commission the people there heard my story got involved and now we are going to be talking about item 120 later on but yesterday i got a notice about something that was stuffed in a handrail i didnt see it it was a week late it wasnt put on my door it wasnt mailed to me so im just saying the notification process is already broken its still    115522 am  broken forget telling neighbors who live beyond 500 feet whats going on when i talk to them on my walk they say well have all this new traffic because of this huge development ive been here 25 years total since the early 90s on and off but the last time 22 years im looking at homelessness having to live in crappy craigs list renter roommate situations which never last the last one involved somebody with almost assaulted me thats not tenable ive been in this apartment for a year and it feels like home literally theres a sign out front that says that council member vela had to get involved to get the developer to even come to the table they havent come anywhere close to meeting our warranted needs theyre not even demands theyre warranted needs because were going to land on our asses many people have been living here for years as has been mentioned theyre veterans i support what the speakers with gave and others have said that you can change the policy you can build   115623 am  more but it has to be actually affordable not this capital a mfi baloney that doesnt work  buzzer were allowed to move back here in a few years but we wont be able to afford it lets get real the process is broken noun and youre talking about making it less democratic and that offends me deeply as a person who lives in austin i am a community volunteer    thank you speaker your time has expired   mayor adler thank you   zenobia joseph items 27 39 49 53 and 68   mayor may i ask a technical question first   yes   i signed up in person for the vmu item 51 and 52 and went to the clerks office first can you just tell me if they   115723 am  merged the two sets of items   you can speak on those zoning items   im asking if it was set for 52 58 and 80 i didnt hear the clerk say it a minute ago   yes    okay thank you mayor council im zenobia joseph just wanted to make a few comments as it relates to 51 thats the metrorapids i actually am opposed to that item i want to call to your yesterday the neighborhood association chair barbara scott mentioned that the colony park area will not benefit from the expo park and ride that will eventually be in   115823 am  that area but not people in colony park we doesnt think they will get in their cars and ride downtown on the bus as it relates specifically to the austin strategic mobility plan i just want to remind you that title vi as specified on page 225 which prohibits discrimination based on race color and national origin so when youre talking about 80 the vertical mixed use i just want to call to your attention that 80 area median income on the median family income is more than most africanamericans earn thats about give thousand dollars your study in 2020 for economic development said africanamericans earn about 42000 so i would ask you to update the code to ensure that essential workers who earn about 60 area median income can actually own homes as well i am for the faulk library expansion and sent some information to ask that you actually designate an area for africanamericans based   115924 am  on the erasure of africanamerican history as for 27 i am supposed to the money for kazi i appreciate you want to stream the council members on air however they are beholden to council and play propaganda as related to project connect on the air and they refuse to put an antirail ad based on their bias towards the city i would lastly just add that as you look at the vertical mixed use that you include parkland dedication if you do down yager lane which i did this morning  buzzer its a concrete junk gel which was once dense forest so height is one thing but lets not actually exacerbate the problems that africanamericans and low income people have as comes to social determinants of health as relates lastly to number 49 thats the leander isd    thank you speaker your time has expired   i wanted to thank the staff for sending me the   120025 pm  information yesterday but it doesnt say how austin and traffic residents would benefit from leander prek if you have any questions ill gladly answer them at this time   mayor adler thank you    that concludes remote speakers   mayor adler all right colleagues it

kelly mario cantu bobby breeden   mayor adler hang on a second thank you come on down   good afternoon mayor and council i represent regency health care which is a big agency here in austin we own 14 of our nursing and rehab centers we came up with a new program and were trying to   120957 pm  get the information out as much as we can on hiring seniors and juniors and training them and getting them that career they want to pursue right now we are currently hiring the six on the left side of that flyer you have and we train them we pay for it so its a good program if they want to go to cna school and they show that they are dedicated well send them to school and train them same with the medical assistance to pass meds and stuff well send them to school and train them currently i have a nurse in school that were supporting and shes working flexible hours at night and that way she can still support her family its a good program we started and were just trying to get the information out to the greater city of austin we have 14 communities right here nine in austin two in bastrop one in he will begin and were just trying to get the information out   mayor adler thank you   harpermadison mayor   121057 pm  i dont see the flyer he made reference to   this one   mayor adler why dont you give it to the clerk and she will make sure we get copies   harpermadison thank you   mario cantu    go ahead   good evening council   mayor adler im sorry i didnt know you were waiting   i just want a bit of silence for these individuals in mental health    mayor adler by the way its a threeminute time on public speaking   thank you just a little bit of time for these individuals that were in uvalde getting impacted with the children having to work on them working on children is very   121157 pm  very difficult its not easy work at all next public hearings so mental health the top three stressors contributing to a poor state of mental health include career finances and lack of sleep if you look at the bottom it says currently many agencies utilize a time frame of 12 hours 16 hours or 24 hour shifts you know those shifts we really cant change a lot of that the career we might finances we could lack of sleep we really dont change because you have to have health care workers working at night they cant all go home and then come out of their house to go to work and pick you up theyre working 24 hours a day all year long next so its no secret that the occupation with the ems results in a high stress work environment ems workers are regularly exposed to the realities of human sufferings and   121257 pm  strategy including death stressors can be grouped into three general categories routine work demands critical incidents involving serious harm or death and social conflicts social conflicts often you would encounter on a scene with family arguing interaction with family members or neighbors something like that where someone has been shot stabbed hurt so thats what that would include next and i think this one is really important because in addition to many providers seek overtime hours outside of their normal scheduled shifts or employed with multiple agency resulting in work backup shifts and this is largely reported due to the pay discrepancy within the ems community many providers report feeling as though the additional hours worked on a necessity to obtain a comfortable financial   121359 pm  standing so some individuals mainly a lot have to work another job in order to pay the bills again career finances i think is a very important thing to look at can that be fixed yes we can fix finances  and hourly wage for ems paramedics emts and the 911 dispatchers again lack of sleep they have to work through that on their own because of the shifts and the dedication that they give also i wanted to include that a lot of the ems paramedics emts are required to have continued education hours with a lot of training every four years for their certification and paramedics often have to do 120 hours or more  buzzer thank you   mayor adler thank you   jordan perez   121508 pm  moving on to remote speakers pat vallestrelles   thank you for letting me speak this is pat mayor mayor pro tem and council members can yall hear me   yes   okay thank you i am a former member of the animal advisory commission and current president rent of district 9 in 2015 the city auditor published a report that stated the animal services office continues to meet the citys 90 live outcome goal however animal services does not have sufficient facilities and resources allocated to meet the goal and remain in line with the state requirements and industry best practices as a result the citys animal shelters are overcrowded animals are not consistently receiving the   121609 pm  recommended level of care and response times to calls for assistance are untimely in addition animal services does not have sufficient processes to record and prioritize all reducing their ability to manage field operations i have sent you the link for this report in an email and i want to continue by saying that animal services continues to be underfunded in 2022 the citys animal shelter continues to be overcrowded animals are still not receiving the recommended level of care and calls to 311 continue to not be answered in a timely manner you recently received an email from a city resident i believe he lives in district 3 and i believe the  and i know the email a dog that was killed on the street because of lack of 311 response to that call   121711 pm   the report about loose dogs the animal advisory commission to date has not made time to discuss the request by animal services for additional staff choosing instead to call a last minute special called meeting for this friday night to discuss stray hold times an issue that hasnt been discussed prior to this week the animal advisory commission also has a meeting on monday evening i hope the commission will recommend additional staff for animal services at that time to address the underfunding and overcrowding if the commission fails to recommend additional staffing i request the council ask the city auditor for an updated report and ask for a fair and unbiased review of animal shelter staffing thanks very much   frances acuna   121815 pm   can you hear me   yes go ahead

when i visited the city of austin web page and it has a place for developers to put affordable housing but ive noticed that most of the time the 10 affordable housing available is for the 60 mfi and up including  excluding low income communities i hear that some people must be displaced i now realize that the   121917 pm  people who must be displaced are the people that earn 60 and below which is all of us who have made positive changes in our community i was told that if i wanted to fight for my home i need to get my representatives attention i need to know how they think or how you think how you speak your language i need to learn if youre republican or democratic in other words i need to become an expert in your job why do i need to learn your language why do i need to learn about vertical mixed use equity transit oriented development project connect austin strategic mobility plan land development code and imagine austin just so i could try to fight to stay   122019 pm  in my home you are working on our behalf why does it look like you are against us all the low income communities why do we feel that youre trying to get rid of us thats what were feeling especially the renters and the very low income communities we feel that you are trying to get rid of us and this is our  homes and i just want to stop there because i do want to say before the time is up that theres two other residents that are in the queue that they dont have translation and i dont know if anybody there to translate for them but im willing to   122122 pm  and thats all i have   mayor i think ms

spanish   good morning my name is irene hernandez and i live   122332 pm  in zip code 78744   speaking spanish   today i am speaking because i was disappointed the last time that i came to speak with the communication services and the interpretation when we came to speak about our needs   speaking spanish   when we signed up to speak last time the way that things were interpreted didnt communicate everything that we said   speaking spanish    122434 pm   its very important that when we speak that were actually heard especially because the time it takes for us to work to come here   speaking spanish   when we speak its very important to the things that we say are heard and that you pay attention to the process so that we understand what is said and were able to speak  speaking spanish   thats severing that i have today thank you very much   122536 pm   mirna rodriguez   speaking spanish   speaking spanish   my name is mirna rodriguez good afternoon and i live in 78744 zip code in

speaking spanish we want you to make sure that you interpret for speakers well so that you understand what it is that were asking for our communitys needs  speaking spanish the last time we came to speak we werent given enough time and the things we said werent interpreted well and we need to make sure that when we come to speak that we are heard and listened to  speaking spanish   we take our time out of   122741 pm   work to come and testify but without good interpretation if you cant hear what were saying its impossible for you to understand the obstacles that we face as a community  speaking spanish so i ask of you that you make sure that we are interpreted for and treated with dignity respect and complete understanding for what were saying  speaking spanish   122849 pm   we are a working community and we deserve to have the right to be heard and to be treated with respect when you dont listen to the things that we say or when we cant understand what you say then youre not respecting the word of the community and we deserve the right to be heard  speaking spanish a lot of us actually understand the language we understand whats being said in english we prefer to speak in our own native language because we can more   122950 pm  comfortably express ourselves and you can hear what were going through and we are no less deserving of the dignity and the respect of being heard  speaking spanish im very proud to live in this community im very proud of what i do for my community and i am proud to come here and to talk to you about what my community needs its essential that you treat us with dignity and respect so that we can continue to speak on behalf of our community   perla hernandez   123055 pm   speaking spanish   speaking spanish   my name is perla and i also

our community sometimes our words arent well translated and were not able to advocate for our community well  speaking spanish the last time that we spoke there wasnt enough time to correctly state the things we were asking for and to correct what we spoke on for our community  speaking spanish   we have the right as a community to come and speak on what we need and be listened to since we know what is happening  speaking spanish   123324 pm  weve taken the time out of work to come and speak and to speak on behalf of others in our community for their needs when we come to speak and our words are translated if theyre not translated well then its impossible for you to hear the obstacles were facing as a community  speaking spanish we ask that you listen to us with respect that you work on better translation and you take into account our concerns as residents as we speak i also wanted to say i missed a line from mirna this is a tough translation this is carmen speaking   123426 pm  for

probably too many items on executive session to deal with in 30 minutes    mayor adler i think we will but i think we can probably start in executive session because i think there are questions that

everyone to live inside permanent supportive housing projects like cady lofts are specifically designed to include an array of services aimed at helping folks to successfully retain housing i have attended like 80 or 100 public hearings in my career as a city planner and never before seen the voices in support of a project like this outweigh those opposed to it and thats exactly what i saw at the pnc hearing the hearts and minds of your constituency are with this project and based on their comments projects like this given the dual crises of homelessness and affordable housing every affordable housing project should be celebrated and this project is only the beginning to really make a real difference we need 30 more projects just like this in austin a there is something like 3100 people experiencing homelessness so this is only the start thank you for your time   mayor adler thank you   24042 pm   jao paulo speaking on item 92   i am sorry i am sally gaskin i am one of the principals and codeveloper of cady lofts and i am only here if there are questions of the applicant   mayor adler thank you   i dont want to take up your time thank you   good afternoon i am joy brown i am the president and ceo of new co housing in houston texas i have been working with the homeless housing the homeless and offering services since 1996 new hope housing has supportive housing in houston 1500 units strong and 700 of those units are dedicated to permanent supportive housing housing the chronic homelessness this is our expertise  it is our focus it is our mission and it is my honor to be   24144 pm  supporting cady lofts here in austin  offering consulting and guidance in aspects having to do with building design with services and with the management of the property once it is open i commend the prior speaker who spoke out in support it is wonderful and inspiring that you would  you in austin are realizing and taking action thank you   mayor adler before you leave i really want to thank you and new hope for coming into our community we have a challenge here and we have many wonderful service providers and property  managers and our community is asking each of them to scale because we need to meet the challenge and we have set a goal to house 3000 increment tall additional people in three years it is going to require them to scale but it is also going to require us to bring in additional providers and participants and you coming into   24246 pm  our market and our city is something that is greatly appreciated also greatly appreciated is your willingness to work with some of the organizations that we have in town like the austin area urban league that have indicated a willingness to also put their shoulder to this challenge so that if you work with and mentor and teach and we can get to more equitable community of service providers in our city it is something also that i want to thank new hope for participating in   well i very warmly thank you and let me mention the only way this works is as a collaborative effort the only way it works and in houston new hope housing works with more than 43 services partners so we have some idea how to make   24347 pm  that work we know it always must be adapted for the specific property and the city and we are here to do that and thank you so very much   mayor adler thank you   thank you  applause   jao paulo connolly speaking on item 92   hi councilmembers sorry for the confusion there a little earlier and i will keep this brief i just want to thank every single one of you who has from the beginning has added your names to the statement in support and helped us form a rallying cry around this project in our community we know this is just one project it is very important it is 100 units and we need so much more but the similar follow like value of this project and getting everyone to stand behind it is to say this is an absolute priority for our community and we cant afford to lose even a single one of these deals and i also wanted to say that   24448 pm   you know i think there have been several housing items on the agenda today some big discussion around ads around updating our vmu ordinance around parking and setbacks and compatibility and i want to say that you know if you look at cities throughout the country the cities that have the most constrained supplies of housing have the worst crisis around homelessness so dont think that we can get out of homelessness simply by focusing on permits of support housing but we need affordable at every tier and we need to think radical radical and big how we will increase the housing supply in the city   mayor adler thank you and mr conway thanks to you too on this effort with this property which i think was el inspiring to see a neighborhood that stepped forward this is a neighborhood at was alerting us to challenges they were having with encampments   24549 pm  but this is also a neighborhood that stepped forward not just to do that but to really step forward and be a part of the solution you and the austin justice coalition helped to organize that effort to make sure that community had the available information so thank you as well   thank you mayor and i also want to thank jen the folks from the neighborhood folks from the neighborhood association for being willing and open to this dialogue about this promise and for being willing to reconsider their initial position on the project and we look forward to having much more dialogue with the neighborhoods about these projects in future

event size venue charter academy has a proven history of being a dysfunctional location for a large club it never has worked for neighborhood the concert gores or the clubs financial success now it is less connected to south congress than it ever was every neighbor and every   24855 pm  neighboring objects only specifically to the large nightclub and projected slow motion drunken gridlock on academy this is plainly a disruptive and dangerous in the middle of a neighborhood i also feel it is important to point out that historically in every discussion about the functional and functionality and safety in all a of its iteration it is neighbors have proposed making the entrance on the and chris had and the opportunity to buy the access to congress in the nineties and he didnt and i think i dont know why we should suffer for his lack of planning that way   mayor adler thank you   eric van height item 103 on deck will bridges   items one does 103 will bridges on deck zach ernst   24958 pm       hello i am will bridges coowner of arlen studios and angelo nightclub and some other classic brick and mortars like ciscos cabaret and lamb berths and speaking in items of 102 and 103 i have given testimony several times now to both you and the city planning commission about the importance of adding a 1200 capacity venue back into our local live music ecosystem i believe that we have established that the austin opera house is a historical and cultural significance and should be saved the only question that remains is that what size and capacity if we make it too small it is no longer the austin opera house in order to do this project right and recreate the experience of the original austin opera house as 1200 capacity music venue we need at least 12500 square feet of the original structure to work with because of that fact i sincerely ask that council recommend and approve the venue be that size thank you   25059 pm   zach ernst on deck michelle key   hello council i am here in favor of items 102 and 103 i am an austin music industry can employee since 2007 and a property owner the travis heights neighborhood since 2014 currently i am the buyer at the theatre and antons but before that a musician honey bears grew in stature this 2008 2009 we grew from red delivery selling out 1200 sofa rosa the when it was around giving an opportunity to local musician is important to our ecosystem and important to our success in hosting multiple venues i can say our calendars are generally full from september through may and we pass on a lot of music shows by local bands because we dont have the dates available there is a need for another 1200 capacity room in austin a   25159 pm  especially one with a commitment to local artists like to opera house will be thank you    michelle cahey also speaking on items 102 103 on deck laura tu pes   my name is michelle cahey i live on melissa lane across the street from the parking lot of 200 academy i am a native austinite and i have lived in my 1928 bungalow for the past 20 years having lived in austin for 53 years now i know the history of austin and all of the wonderful nightclubs i am in opposition of the proposed music venue on 200 academy the neighborhood has been inundated with the impact of visitors that come to enjoy the new development along the north end of soco living in this newly developed area has added many challenges to our daily commute as we only have two ways to access our home from academy and the other  from  refer   25300 pm   six riverside constant traffic jams on parked trucks scooters zooming through at high speeds and pedestrians on their phone crossing the road the congestion leaves cars hanging into on coming traffic on south congress   bringing back the opera house will only add to the congestion we are already experiencing thank you   mayor adler thank you   item 102 and 103 laura tupes on deck april brown   good afternoon laura tupes representing neighborhood working groups we have gone from asking for no music venue to something the size of nearby local clubs to now accepting 10000 square feet we do still have numerous concerns about this increased size safety to pedestrians emergency access and compatibility based on the access from just a 30foot wide neighborhood   25402 pm  street most recently we met with patrice pike a long time musician and member of the music commission we weighed her input around the size that will serve local musicians versus the applicants request that will just serve large names we struggled to increase our proposed 3000 square foot venue to over three times that to the proposed 10000 it is difficult for us to say we support this but we can say we accept it and we believe it serves the local music community and the developer while not really serving the neighborhood today i ask you to vote in favor of the 10000 square foot cap along with other conditions thank you   mayor adler thank you   april brown speaking on item 103 on deck michael well len  mayor council april brown   25506 pm  on behalf of the applicant i would like to take a moment to highlight what is lost earlier the biggest question before you today is the venue size but the crux of that question is really the venue capacity so as you know the original venue was 17500 square feet and we are asking for 125 what is most important is it does not equate to pure audience area you have to account for stage backup house bathrooms et cetera so in other words the occupancy is calculated differently depending on the use within the space for example the audience area would be one person for seven feet the stage would be one person for 15 and then the backup house and the lounge and the museum area would be 30 feet per person additionally other areas are not in the calculation all stairs egress bathrooms so all  that to say it is not a simple seven to one or nine to one an example we are familiar with is dumonts the area is 2700 square feet and the gas is 63 people so that   25607 pm  is really 42 square feet per person so a i would like to say it is not a simple venue of capacity to be impacted by the design thank you   mayor adler thank you   speaking on item 103 michael well len on deck sean garrison   michael on behalf of the applicant a lot of negotiations going on here and really really close might not be able to close the gap we have agreed to accept the neighborhood  they asked us to remove some permitted uses and agreed and are amenable to those communication services pats local utility services outdoor sports and recreation safety services and also agreed as they requested that any outdoor sports or entertainment be conditional uses and i think where this all ends up is on the 12000  right now 17500 square foot venue with a stage and a lobby area the audience area is 10000 square foot we are amenable to reducing that by almost 30 percent   25709 pm  almost 285 participant to 12500 square feet and a men to believe that as a compromise to be done with this and we know that mid size venues are important in this community we know that for live music i think this will at least provide some to some extent some of that the last thing is that the compatibility setback be moved from 75 feet to 65 feet to allow for a little bit more housing on the track 3 thank you   mr  i am sorry mayor     tovo i know the neighborhood as youve described has moved a great deal from asking you to consider no venue to now not supporting but standing alongside a 10000 square foot veep ewe venue what is your response   i appreciate that the irony is 10500 is the midpoint between where they started and 17500 which a 30   25812 pm   reduction means that the stage which is 4000 square feet and the lobby will have to be physically modified as will the audience area which is currently 10000 to make it work well have to modify all three of those aspects in order to make it work because you have to include everything you have to include the bathroom lobby stage all gets included in that 12500   tovo you dont have the ability to do it now its not a reduction you dont have the ability to have that use   thats correct absolutely   tovo so were in the middle of a council meeting theres a lot going on theres not an agreement do you want time to talk with the neighborhood to think this through if there is a valid petition and the valid petition is not supporting your request   weve talked and talked were still talking maybe well have an opportunity in the next few minutes while the remaining folks are talking for us to talk and reach that   25915 pm  opportunity i know theres mixed support and a valid petition im aware of what that means i appreciate the reminder   tovo youre welcome   life is a bowl of cherries youve got to take them one at a time and spit out the pit   tovo thank you it seems like the neighborhood thats come forward with what is more than a reasonable proposal and i look forward to hearing if you have a different response a little later in the meeting   cool thanks   tovo thanks very much   sean item 104 on deck jennifer long on deck roger taylor

wholeheartedly the developer has been responsive and listened to the neighborhood has done a great job of encouraging the neighborhood to use the property while its vacant i think that we need as much affordable housing as we can get and i think that our street is pretty unique its an old industrial street this is four acres of green field that theres no displacement i think its a pretty slam dunk project thank you   mayor adler thank you   alma item 104105 on deck chase wright   good afternoon my name is emil developer of   30228 pm  the franklin project i live a mile from the site i work on

afternoon chase wright president of the springdale park neighbors where i work with unhoused residents were in the process of building a pilot program every day we work on  rehabilitation a lot of these unhoused residents suffer from mental health issues chronic homelessness longterm substance abuse and at the end of the day as we rehabilitate them they are moving towards structured lives the problem is we have nowhere for them to go a lot of them live in tents they dont have any history i do a little research and we come across projects like em franklin i live in this neighborhood 202 greenwood its a nobrainer we need supportive housing units affordable housing units and when these unhoused residents and people that are   30430 pm  highrisk need somewhere to go these are the homes theyre going to use right now on my block theres only a 3000 square foot home that is being built right now if we get a couple of those theres no more room density and worrying about    buzzer

on deck brian   speaking on item 120   good evening council you know earlier i spoke about displacement   30530 pm  and i also did speak about item 52 in regards to promises and when promises are made i mentioned that things need to be in writing these individuals here at this apartment complex  and why am i standing up here speaking about these individuals that are not even in my district but i was born and raised in austin and i know a lot of the parts of austin and so we have to take care of ourselves here for the ones that have been born and raised here in austin and i feel that its really important that we take care of these individuals and figuring out we do not displace these individuals and things need to be in writing with these individuals as well as conversations and discussions with the applicants and the buyers and the developers and so i ask councilmember vela to make sure that this takes place and that if a postponement is needed honor   30630 pm  that postponement for the neighborhood thank you    buzzer sounding    brian mcgivern on deck paul saldaa   hello members of council my name is brian mcgivern some of you may know me an attorney with the austin community law center im here  ive been working with the residents association on a pro bono basis around this issue and i think the point among the others that i would like to emphasize is that this really is  although at a superficial level and could look like an issue between development and preservation its about tenant displacement it makes me think back to the tenant relocation ordinance which is not applicable here nothing is being demolished yet   30733 pm  but the findings and the spirit built into this ordinance are directly applicable they talk about the huge burdens caused to residents when they are displaced from their homes and the resulting communitywide impacts and i hope that there is a broad consensus for helping renters i look back on the vote on the relocation ordinance    buzzer sounding    well thank you for your time   mayor adler thank you   paul saldaa speaking on item 123 on deck megan phillips   megan phillips item 118   30839 pm   good afternoon my name is megan phillips i live near the 12th street corridor and i just wanted to speak on 118 and 86 i am concerned about music  live music venues that have outdoors our neighbors  were new to the neighborhood but our neighborhood almost everybody has been there for decades and there are a lot of singlefamily homes it seems like if theres going to be development thats different han what the neighborhood had agreed to it should be focused on affordable housing rather than live music venues thank you for your time   i believe that concludes our inperson speakers sorry one more speaker lauren stanley   30941 pm   items 4 and 5 9495   lauren stanley im an architect i build and design for a living this project entails such a jump in zoning from sf3 to mf4 its hard to imagine it as anything but a shapeshifter for the block and the neighborhood we know austin is trying to house itself we must also try not to unhouse ourselves many jjc residents are concerned a singular focus on adding housing stock will be the dissolution of a neighborhood fabric physically socially and environmentally if we go down this path it will come at a cost and risk unintended consequences after many hours considering this project for almost two years and in full accordance with the need to grow we still see this project is too much for this site its perfect for a grayfield corridor site its scraped now but three years ago this was a green field lush with fruit and oak trees the proposed impervious cover   31043 pm  would increase with entitlements to 75 branch two a creek would undeniably suffer impacts from pavement people excavations and pets   buzzer sounding    theres traffic theres already a thousand unit of influx of affordable housing and other new housing and we agreed to compromise to lower mf and we really ask for moderation on this project thank you   mayor adler thank you   i believe we have two more inperson speakers first up monica on deck carmen   mayor before we turn to that i know you called a speaker just a little while ago for 123 i believe 123 passed on the consent agenda at least it should have its not a zoning item its the item i brought forward to fund the rainey street historic preservation fund   that is correct we misspoke   tovo when we noted it at lunchtime it also hadnt updated   31143 pm  that that had passed   correct   tovo thank you   good afternoon mayor and council monica guzman speaking as a district 4 resident i support the old homestead renters in opposition to 120 the item must be postponed until developer jci provides their requested needs the residents are open to negotiating in good faith since the planning  commission meeting jci has referenced a tenant relocation assistant program but theres no money its a doorway to nowhere jci follows site plans stating zero inhabitants on the property no vmu zoning change needed therefore not triggering the tra program the tra program is unfunded because the developer has yet to write a check i want to clarify about the program lacking a process i was an active community participant in the work done   31244 pm  resulting in the tenant relocation ordinance it does have a process but its a broken process honor the residents by listening to what they have to say have a discussion   buzzer sounding    i demand you not take a vote tonight not even a first reading thank you   carmen pulido    laughing  im going to be as quick as i can there are actually at least 16 households at clayton lane item 120 that stand to be displaced i want to make it really clear on may 31st the old homestead renters association met with chito velas office he was kind enough to come to their property they requested they wanted this pulled for discussion and they wanted the vote postponed it was a lot of confusion one renter not speaking on   31345 pm  behalf the association communicated with staff about first reading second reading it got confusing because the renters association was not able to discuss that they would like you to postpone the vote on this item its really important to give them the leverage they need so they can get these very minimal basic things that will mitigate the harm because we have  you heard about veterans theres also an entrepreneur who employs an additional dozen veterans there are substitute teachers there are at least two tenants caring for elderly parents and family members who live in the windsor park area there are immigrants   buzzer sounding    bipoc folks and what you hear from jci not a solution they cant afford the new rents there is nowhere for them to go they need your support and a little bit of leverage to come to some kind of winwin thank you   moving on to remote speakers carrie slater item 86   31446 pm    hi i live on new york avenue and share an alley with 12th ive lived here over 20 years im asking you to oppose conditional use for bars weve been working for years to align the nccd and allowing bars lastminute undermines the good faith intentions to align the documents alcohol was never a permitted use who is asking for this i beg you to reach out to nonureka residents and ask how they feel its been implied only people opposing this are newer lightskinned neighbors and longtime minority residents should have a substantial say i agree has council asked them i have i have not found one neighbor in favor this wont be the old airport lounge it will be an overpriced hipster hangout with houses converted to airbnbs the main ones benefiting are eureka and those working on their behalf its disingenuous to imply the majority of old or new residents support this im asking you to take out the   31548 pm  conditional use for bars whether the intention is to displace residents or not the results will be displacement thank you   mayor adler thank you   buzzer sounding    eric johnson item 86 and 118   my name is eric jansen 1703 new york avenue and a resident of the keighley neighborhood im asking the council today to vote no on allowing cocktail lounge as a conditional use along 12th street ive been active in zoning discussions along this area going back to 2006 and the nccd was structured as a compromise where neighbors would agree to increase density and a reduction in building compatibility protections in exchange for restricted uses along 12th street allowing cocktail lounges will undo the compromise we agreed to   31649 pm  many years ago we just completed the two yearlong community process trying to align regulatory documents for this area neither the urban renewal board nor the planning commission nor city station nor ocean recommended this change please i ask the council i implore you to vote no on this amendment to the urban renewal plan and the 12th street zoning   buzzer sounding    in general i am for the urban renewal plan as it stands but its unclear to us why we need more bars in this area thank you very much    lee sherman items 86 and 118   i live with my family near 12th we support recommendations from the urban renewal and planning commission to align the urp and nccd the amendment strengthens that intent please vote no on expanding   31750 pm  cocktail use permission in the area more bars are not needed to support the goal of a vibrant african american cultural and heritage district we have six or seven already historically there were fewer how many more do we need and whats to stop proliferation that ultimately distracts from black lives history in favor of partying why is the zoning at 180112th street shown as cs1 collar with 1806 are those typos 78701 there were 186dwis last year most centered around rainey we dont want those coming to east 12th or a resumption of inebriated people around homes that come from a concentration of bars think of rainey street if you look at conditional use permits all were approved thanks for listening   tracy white items 86 and 118   31850 pm   council this is tracy witte todays second reading i appreciate that the nccd draft ordinance posted but the urp land use portion is yet to be updated this process has been years in the making alignment  for review and lastminute amendments on first reading that undo significant planning compromises around which our community coalesced staff informed us yesterday 20 of the area around the nccd must be represented in a petition to be valid it would be helpful to understand why and whether there are similar negotiated plan areas that follow that same limitation why should adjacent owners protest rights be diminished because changes apply to the entire district neighbors are uncomfortable with cocktail lounge use i agree with everything that lee and carrie just said the land use table does not capture the indoor specifications discussed last time please vote no on the cocktail lounge piece and please ensure   31951 pm  complete text of the urp and nccd are posted within ten days of anticipation before third reading thank you   buzzer sounding     mitch orenger 86 and 118   vote no on expanding permission on east 12th street and the nccd show the current venues and bars thank you very much   bradley price items 92 and 93   32052 pm   yes im a hancock neighborhood resident four blocks from the proposed development since 1984 i have supported this development since i first became aware of it permanent supportive housing is the way out of homelessness as consultants on this project at new hope housing have proven and similar developments in houston katie will reduce the number of chronically homeless by around a hundred so its a great move not only for the target population but also for the city as a whole i want to congratulate also the hancock neighborhood association for recently voting to support this project after consulting with city staff elected officials and advocates for the homeless the association decided not to be part of the problem but part of the solution my neighbors and i look forward to ensuring that katie voss lives up to its promised potential members of the council please   32153 pm  approve katie loss   buzzer sounding    zenobia joseph 86 118 and 119   thank you mayor council im zenobia joseph i just wanted to make some comments as it relates to 11th and 12th street as ive made in the past specifically related to the preservation of east austins cultural history im opposed to the unlimited   indiscernible  northbound its been amended many times for density development but density doesnt equate to diversity i asked you about the black embassy when i spoke the last time and there has been a memorandum from brian on march 11th 2022 that says   32255 pm  that  university would be studying the economic implications to african americans and there would be a study report in the late spring well here we are in the summer so mayor last night david chapman  you know where african americans are in east austin when it comes to the churches but what have you done to help us with the economic development   buzzer sounding    i would ask you to please stop kicking this can down the road and do something for african americans before your term expires and lastly i would just say that as it relates to transportation i have said before 12th street the bus that runs there interlines with the 60minute bus that goes to northeast austin and african americans wait 60 minutes for the bus which goes against the contract that youve had since 2020 if you have any questions ill gladly answer them at this time   mayor adler thank you   32357 pm   joshua ellenger item 92   ive lived  i live right next to the katie loss development im probably the neighbor whos been paying the most attention to it originally i was opposed to it the basis for opposing it really is that it didnt  we were approached late and i didnt have enough detail but over time i got to where i kind of changed my opinion and now i support it because yes i want it in my backyard because its going to be awesome i do have a couple concerns left the first one is the developers do not own the property and if the zoning change goes through and the tax credits dont theres a risk that it will get turned into market development id like you  haca to shut down that risk by moving ahead with the property purchase the land purchase theyre planning to do that   32458 pm  anyway the second thing if i may be so bold is i would ask the mayor to give a call to michael and shannon long who are the two doctors who own a lot of property    buzzer sounding    near this development we could have had a bigger development if we had worked together six months ago potentially but id like him to call them and see if theyre interested in selling that property for a phase two of kitty loss so anyway its going to be awesome the neighborhoods going to be behind it its taken us a while to get there but welcome to the neighborhood   cohen item 92   hi everyone im the president of the hancock neighborhood association on june 2nd 95 of members stated were no longer opposed    32559 pm  to the zoning change these hundred units would help address the need for 3000 units in austin and the mf4 zoning requested is more compatible than the originally proposed and katie loss would only be 48 feet tall we request a conditional overlay limiting market rate to 50 feet if this project is not built we have a few outstanding concerns with the project katie needs an analysis to make it safe since 39th street is a narrow cutthrough with no sidewalks and parking on both sides making it difficult to reach transit networks on red river this should be addressed the project to build psh relies on developers to identify sites theres an opportunity to make this less contentious to accelerate the building of units hna looks forward to working on the site plan and ensuring the best outcome for this project   32659 pm  thank you   chip harris item 100   mayor mayor pro tem my name is chip harris im requesting that you deny this rezoning that allows additional vehicular access tomorrow street agenda item 100 current accounts done by the city show 1990 vehicle trips on morrow already over 50 higher than the level of 1200 trips for residential streets based on the citys land development code section 25616 the crestview neighborhood association has always been opposed to opening to more traffic due to concerns that traffic will revert to prior levels of over 9000 trips per   32801 pm  day please pause this process of changing the ordinance in order to engage with those morrow residents who will bear the brunt of traffic in order to develop and approve the city plan that monitors the traffic and outlines specific actions the city could take to reduce volume and protect the residential integrity of morrow street    buzzer sounding    by identifying roadway modifications to be made should traffic volumes on morrow exceed certain thresholds

neighbors i hope that you vote in favor thank you   john hagar items 104 and 105   thank you i am also speaking today with the development on franklin residents  contact team  approached us about this

development our naturally occurring   33309 pm  affordable housing is disappearing quickly and most new affordable housing options  additionally the internal ads could offer opportunities for older residents to age in place this is the type of project we need to encourage in austin and i hope that you approve it thank you so much   stephanie items 104 and 105   my name is stephanie in favor of

the rezoning the developer seeking the zoning change approached our neighborhood two years ago to begin sharing the project we were impressed not only with his vision for the property but also with his sincere commitment to consistently engaging with us taking care to listen to our hopes and concerns as a result of this constructive dialogue and his willingness to compromise in order to help protect these things that we value including the creeks that run alongside our neighborhoods we voted in favor of supporting his project we hope that you will vote to approve the zoning necessary to bring it to life thank you   hogan   hi for 20 years   33610 pm  and our house is next to the alley between 12th and 13th street so any bar or live music venues would literally feel like theyre in our backyard years ago there was a lot of illicit activity in the alley and that scenario has improved but now with this proposal the former problem would be replaced by a new one so we feel this would be a big step backward for our neighborhood and we ask you to please vote no on the proposal to put bars and live music venues on east 12th thank you   carl milligan item 118   hello im in sport with the city staffs urb recommendation for the vision of my community in regards to items 86 118 and 119 i am in district one and have lived in east austin for over three decades i have been impacted with the changes in my neighborhood and i will do all i can to make sure the support goes where it needs to im in support of the urbs   33712 pm  initiative and hope that everyone else is on board please support councilmember harpermadisons motion thank you   daniel nelson item 118    council thanks for allowing me to speak my wife and i live in a house we own on east 13th street weve had careers teaching in public schools in east austin as well as being members of the artist and musician communities i have lived in the neighborhood since 1992 when i rented a house nearby on san bernard street in 2002 we were fortunate to be able to purchase a property on east 13th street where weve lived for 20 years our property shares an alley with properties on east 12th that would be affected by the changes i am against proposals that would allow bars cocktail lounges or live music venues on   33814 pm  east 12th street one thing that i can say i have never heard any of my neighbors express in my 30 years in this neighborhood is a need for more bars on east 12th street again bars are not something that are lacking in austin in general they are not something that are lacking in east austin specifically and bars are not something that are conducive to the family friendly neighborhood that this has been in the past and i hope will continue to be in the future so please vote no on this proposal thank you   jane weber item 20   thats jake weber thank you council for letting me speak i have been asked to relay that vela has promised to postpone the vote until third reading on the 16th past that i am the organize   33915 pm  working with the hold homestead renters for a few weeks there are several renters who will be displaced to the level of homelessness with some this is an extremely important issue its not just about preserving the property there is need for housing in the area but it cannot be done at the risk of causing more homelessness so as the deal is a 55 million deal with over 1 million in parkland dedication funds and over 100000 to remove two heritage trees we are asking for less than 100000 from developers so we ask that you value human beings and please demand the developers keep their current promise   buzzer sounding    and push them to offer more for these displaced tenants if the city is not willing to allocate funds to tenant relocation the developer has to step up and offer compensation to displaced tenants in this   34016 pm   case so please step up to bat for tenants who are being displaced uprooted made homeless i was priced out of austin this year my rent went up by 40 in oak hill and i had to leave the city i grew up in that is a cause dear to my heart i believe that austin needs more housing but not at the risk of causing more homelessness so please council step up thank you   mayor just  jake is he still on the line   no would you like us to get him back   vela no i just wanted to tell him thank you for his efforts with regard to the tenants and i wanted to say that it is my intention to hear the presentation and discussion but postpone  to request a postponement of the item without   34117 pm  a vote i wanted to let council and the audience know item 120   zachary zayier item 120   yes hello city council my name is zach i live on hillcrest drive near the parcel of land considered for item 120 i support a delay of the readings of this property to provide more time to the residents to work through determining a plan for relocation if this change is approved it is my understanding the property is seeking fee in lieu rather than parkland dedication the most direct way to ameliorate the lack of parkland is requiring parkland dedication when it is required rather than allowing fee in lieu fee in lieu would make seasons sense if we had parks but our   34218 pm  neighborhood is in need of parkland as far as the density this project is bringing i would be supportive if it could be worked out with the current residents and included parkland dedication thank you   ken purcell item 120   buzzer sounding    hello members thank you for allowing me to speak to you today i am a resident of the old homestead apartments at 1124 clayton lane just a short view i spent 20 plus years in the united states navy i did two tours in iraq five in afghanistan in 2015 as part of my last tour i returned home to austin texas where i got a job at the state health agency in austin when i am forced out of my home after christmas with my state paycheck i can not afford to live in austin im being forced to look north of round rock or spicewood    34321 pm  all we the old homestead apartment residents are looking for our bottom line is were looking for fair assistance from jci the purchaser of the property were asking for assistance in our transition from our homes were looking to possibly move our moveout dates to february 28th were asking that after the sale of the property jci does not charge rent from the day of the sale until february 28th this will allow us to save up money for apartments down payments to bring down the price of the apartments   buzzer sounding    we are asking the city council to ask jci to negotiate with residents and our request for assistance we are asking council to please agree to postpone todays vote until june 16th to give jci time to speak with the residents and to negotiate with us lastly my greatest fear is that when im forced out of this apartment i will be the face you   34424 pm  see underneath the overpass when the apartment closes down three bedrooms will be forced out of their home this year  three renters thank you again for allowing me to speak with you have a good day   loretta tubbs item 120   good afternoon im cochair for the old homestead renters association along with ken i have lived here for 15 years i moved here to be near my parents as their caregiver this has been an oasis and very much feels like home i agree with what ken stated that we are asking and also im not against further development of this property but the size proposed would bring hundreds of people and cars to an already stressed narrow block of clayton lane affecting hundreds of lives we have requested just compensation months of rent   34525 pm  waived and moving costs covered since there is no fund as we mentioned to jci in our proposal setting the precedent of compassion would go a long way in helping austin go forward with development while recognizing the humanity involved in forced displacement i am being priced out of the neighborhood i grew up in im on six waiting lists for apartments i have no idea when or if i will qualify   buzzer sounding    thank you for your attention and please consider postponement   nancy harris item 100    nancy harris   can you hear me   can you please speak up   34626 pm   can you hear me   yes go ahead   hello   go ahead   hello my name is nancy speaking on item 100 this intersection was never hadnt  meant to be a street when the tod was planned only emergency access would be allowed the bad behavior started almost immediately when the developer put in a fullblown street when they began to tell homes they told buyers the gate was only temporary then social media got involved as people made up theories of why the gate was there ridiculing the people who only wanted to protect their families the bad behavior continued as some people began to resort to vandalism then complaint about the money the city spent to repair it residents finding other ways to deal with it when the city removed the gate the study was done during covid and a holiday season before anyone in the city was aware the   34727 pm  gate was open how does this end no one can say but cars back up for blocks and people are subjected to the pollution of idling cars and blocked driveways it doesnt bode well you are stripping us of one of the few things we were able to negotiate with this developer   buzzer sounding    if this council votes to rescind the ordinance the neighborhood negotiated it will be rewarding past bad behavior and will join a long line of deceitful promisebreakers please dont do that and i hope that you will read my full speech because one minute is really not enough to go into a lot of the details that go into this case thank you   mayor that concludes remote speakers   mayor adler thank

number 125 on the addendum c140158 is a postponement request by the neighborhood to june 16th   mayor adler i have some questions about what we went through im seeing that you told us discussion items are 102 103 and 120   that is correct   mayor adler on 116 we had said earlier we were going to   35338 pm  postpone that to july 28th is everybody in agreement that it be postponed indefinitely   im happy to explain this is the third postponement request by the applicants they have done nothing in the interim and i think it is time to postpone it indefinitely they can still restart their zoning case and pay the 300 but they are wasting our time right now because they are not following through on things   mayor adler are they here with us theyre here okay good all right can we  so were going to pull 116 so they have a chance to address the council   thats fine   mayor adler okay so the pulled items are 102 103 116 and 120 our next question is we had pulled item 86 were not moving on until we    35438 pm  hear 118119 is that correct   were going to be postponing those mayor   mayor adler 118 and 119 okay   off mic    86 will have a staff postponement request to 728   mayor adler im confused 118 and 119 are  have a valid petition second reading but were talking about postponing 118 and 119   yes one is a public hearing for the urban renewal plan the other two are the zoning cases   mayor adler okay   so what were proposing to do right now is approve the two zoning cases on second reading only and postpone the urban renewal plan public hearing again when we came back for the case on third reading for the zoning cases we would offer up a renewal plan for all three readings   mayor adler okay   35540 pm  yes councilmember renteria   renteria yeah on item 113 i recommend that we just vote on the first reading only we got some late backup some concerns from capital metro and i just want to have a discussion with them to see what is their concern   mayor adler okay so 113 being just on first reading only is the applicant here   yes   mayor adler are they okay with that or do they want this pulled for discussion   theyre okay   mayor adler okay so 113 would be just first reading only 118 and 119 are consent second reading only okay   with regard to the govalle    35640 pm  case councilmember renteria would you like us to bring the case back on the 16th for second and third   renteria yes   okay thank you   mayor adler okay back on the 16th of june mayor pro tem   alter councilmember renteria i appreciate you making that for first reading im uncomfortable with voting on this within 300 feet of the daycare so id like to be seen as voting no on that for now and i will also like to get you know additional information for that case for next week thank you   we did receive the cap metro letter today and uploaded it today so its in the backup   mayor adler okay so is there any motions were going to continue to discuss it no vote is there a motion to approve the consent agenda zoning consent is 92120 and 125 pulling 102 103 116 and   35744 pm  councilmember harpermadison makes that motion is there a second to that mo motion councilmember renteria seconds motion on the consent agenda o councilmember tovo   tovo yes this may necessitate going back to the minutes we approved this meeting but i am looking at how 118 and 119 were captured in the minutes here and it does not reflect my vote against vote against i understand that it is   that it was passed on approval and it was an amendment but if there is a way to make the minutes reflect my disapproval on first reading of the amendment that was offered for cocktail lounge allowing cocktail lounges on 12th i would like that to be reflected and mayor i will vote against that portion of this item as well this time i agree with the speakers and with the other folks who have commented that adding in cocktail lounge as a conditional use along 12th street is just not something i can support   35846 pm   02 councilmember tovo is being recorded as being a no vote on 118 119 further discussion   mayor no vote just on the bees of that what reflects the cocktail lounges on 118 which is 12th street which is the 12th street piece   mayor adler okay    tovo i am not voting against it entirely but registering my formal objection to the piece of it that was added in as an amendment last time on the dais for cocktail lounge   mayor adler right so the record will reflect there is just one vote on this not in pieces   tovo i understand but this is contentious enough i would like to vote against that portion of what we are approving here today i mean i can split the difference i mean i can split it out i could make an amendment but unless there is other support on the dais for removing that portion i am simply going to ask the minutes reflect my opposition to the cocktail lounge use on 12th street   mayor adler so noted thank you councilmember kelly   kelly if it is okay i   35946 pm  would like councilmember tovo how you got to that conclusion i know you mentioned it was contentious but for our understanding and the constituents it may change my mind as well   tovo i talked more about it last time and can certainly talk about it more between second and third reading off the dais but as i mentioned last time i think there is i mean as the councilmember who represents several entertainment districts i also share the concern that some of the nearby neighbors have expressed that allowing that you know originally the ncd did not have that as a use that was encouraged on there the encouragement is for neighborhood services for other kind of things supporting the residents of that area and that there is a electronic interest in making sure that this area does not turn into an entertainment district and i am supportive of that in the original planning objectives for that area and the mr jansen talked about that was an amendment that was added by not by the renewal board or the approval processes that happened before it came to the dais that   40047 pm  was something that was added in   mayor adler that was an interesting debate as i recall some of the residents of that area that go back a little bit earlier than the current residents on that talked about the history of that area culture of that area having small clubs in that area and was asking that neighborhood be allowed to return to what had traditional by been so we have different generations of residents speaking of saving different neighborhood characteristics councilmember    pool     pool i was out of town for the first reading but i wasnt here for this conversation but i tend to agree with councilmember tovo with regard to the entertainment aspects if mayor there were a way that we could ensure that in fact how these small owners if they are   40148 pm  small owners i think there is a big owner that owns all of those properties it is not in fact mom and pops owning those properties anymore but if there were a way to ensure we get back to the way it was that the resident was discussing that might be that might really be significant and i dont  i dont know how we do that but i join my colleague in pressing concerns about a potential for the entertainment district that circles around having a proliferation of bars and i know that is something that we are trying to address on sixth street for example amend we have got some cases in front of us that will  that will be attempting by their use of those properties to make the areas less violent and maybe more family friendly so in the context of some of these other cases we are looking at i tend to agree with councilmember tovo so for that portion i would like   40249 pm  to also urge my objection and have a  i am not voting against the entire case just   mayor adler the record will note your opposition to the alcohol there as well   pool thank you   mayor adler councilmember harpermadison   harpermadison thank you i a i appreciate it councilmember kelly i would like to expand on some of the characterization that has taken place currently i would say that respectfully it is inaccurate including the over 500 people that completed the survey i would like very much to put some emphasis on the fact there was in fact some deep community engagement and i have heard from some folks here today that neighbors on 13th street have their doors knocked on and as sure you i didnt get mine knocked on i think some folks who live on the main street literally dont know they are my neighbors which is interesting with that said though i want to put emphasis on the fact of what we are saying we are going to do there is the conditional   40349 pm  use permit there is literally nobody asking to turn an establishment on 12th street into a bar or a cocktail lounge what we are attempting to do with this addition is open up the opportunity to do so  which also includes a process a public process and a process where council has the opportunity to say yes or who and this is the same same it reflects 0 what is happening on 11th street and literally only one bar on 11th street i want to make sure people are not confusing the opportunity for people to have this conditional use as a carte blanche permission for for establishments on east 12th street to become bars it didnt happen on 11th an wont happen on 12th either i do think as time progression progresses i hope this item passes and as time progresses their fears will be assuaged and recognize what they were afraid of is not what is going to materialize   mayor adler couples kel   40450 pm   kelly thank you for your councilmember kelly  now that i have a picture of what is going on i think there is that fear that is what is happening in our current entertainment districts could happen in other places but not at the point that could happen and i think as a city once we get to address the issues that we are currently having we can use that as a way to prevent it from happening in other areas so i really appreciate the conversation here about this   councilmember renteria   renteria thank you mayor and the person that actually as the person that actually you know grew up in that area and hoe that area very well you know right there on 12th and chicon two blocks either way with the was the entertainment area of that neighborhood and i hate to see it disappear i think that we should you know provide the option for that community to have the   40551 pm  entertainment and activity that they are happy for and i think it would be  it will be a positive step i mean where we have these bars there on 11th street you have big  and you dont hear anybody  there are houses right behind there and we dont hear that kind of protest there so i think we are making a big mistake if we dont allow this to happen   mayor adler okay councilmember mayor pro tem   alter thank you i am going to vote for this today but i did want to just ask if i could get some clarity from councilmember harpermadison i think last time i had asked you i believe on 12th street it is limited to 3500 square at that feet but let street 11th street doesnt have that limit and i am trying to understand why that choice was made understanding in both cases it is a conditional use permit which i appreciate provides the   40654 pm   opportunity and perceivably with the rest of the changes there is an opportunity to have more uses than simply bars in this area so it is a different type of area that results but could you explain that difference or if you dont feel comfortable explaining it today can you please be sure to have that ready for when it comes back for third read something   i would absolutely appreciate the opportunity to explain and answer any questions when it comes back i am hesitant to continue the conversation though because over a dozen people who wanted to come today and speak in favor of the item i encouraged them not to because we recognize that the item was going to come back again on the 26th in which case i think the robust discussion and dialogue should happen then   mayor adler yes   thats fine if you  i just want to make sure i did get an answer before we have the final vote thank you   mayor adler it has been   40759 pm  posted   okay the record will note this there has been a motion and a second to approve the consent agenda any further discussion then lets go ahead and take a vote those on the consent agenda please raise your hand those opposed it is unanimous with the notations of those specific items noted colleagues lets take a break here now and go into executive session to discuss the last items we are not going to closed session to take up

im proud to serve as mayor pro tem of the city of austin and to represent district 10 central northwest austin on the city council today and tonight we are going to mark gun violence awareness month in austin this has been a challenging time you know the last several years have been challenging but the last several weeks have been really heavy for those of us who are concerned about the proliferation of guns and the increased gun violence in our community as an elected official im stunned by the fact that i can   55359 pm   no longer name the number of mass shootings where ive had to offer condolences for the other cities and ive only been in office a little over five years my first week at city hall one of my staff members lost a close relative in a horrible gun and domestic violencerelated incident as a friend i have had to find the words to console after a mentally ill parent twice managed to get a gun and with the second purchase hurt her husband before taking her own life as a mother ive had to hold my breath when my teenage daughter stepped out of my car in the school parking lot as i figured out how to let go after an active shooter threat at her high school the last several weeks with the mass shootings with uvalde buffalo and the dozen  i dont know how many over the last weekend  its been tough   55501 pm  its been really really tough to look at the gun violence but i am choosing hope and i am choosing action at the local level each of us is committed and will continue to advocate at the state and federal level for gun responsibility and for gun safety but we are going to keep marching on the path that we have set for ourself as a community over the last several years and take local action yesterday i took hope in the 65+ elected officials law enforcement members and community leaders who joined us during the day for a summit on gun violence that i hosted with da garza who is with us with mayor adler and judge brown we talked for hours frankly about the challenges that we have in our community and the   55601 pm  opportunities that we have to move forward with a strategy based in data grounded in our survivors looking to what we can do to interrupt violence and making sure that our law enforcement efforts to effect gun violence are strong and moving everyone in the room  we had the superintendent of the school district we had several councilmembers and we could not include everyone but im sure that all of my colleagues would have been there the court commissioners judges we had councilmembers from other cities in travis county and we had the county attorney lots and lots of folks were together and everyone is united in our efforts that we need to build up our ecosystem we each have our part but we also need to do it collectively and im proud that we at the city of austin are leading the   55702 pm  way with our office of violence prevention which was launched after recommendation of our gun task force from 2019 and a process they initiated with my colleagues in the 2020 budget we are already making those adjustments and we will guide our strategic plan so that we can be focused and strategic  begun violence in our community and the thing begun violence in our community is that it looks more like domestic violence suicide interpersonal conflict that escalates to a shooter leading to a death or an accidental discharge of a gun those are problems that we begin to tackle and continue to tackle yes it would be easier if there werent access to guns but stilchrealprntw   55904 pm  and the many other people who are here today to recognize this do hereby proclaim june 2022 as gun violence awareness month in austin id now like to invite up kimberly to say a few brief remarks shell be followed by robin of moms demand action and nicole golden all of whom are going to be brief   thank you thank you for having me here today my name is kim and i work for the community justice action fund i live in austin and our work at cjf is to build power with and for communities of color to end gun violence i want to first thank mayor pro tem for her leadership and constant support for the issue of gun violence over many years   60008 pm  our team is honored to work with you and the creation of the office of violence prevention in 2022 and were grateful for the comprehensive efforts that we are starting to put forth as you know incidence of gun violence have been constant the massacres in recent weeks are examples of this community justice action fund works round the clock to ensure that the folks most impacted by gun violence are centered and are elevating the cures and specifically have worked hand in hand with partners like the austin office of violence prevention to support their efforts and advocate for local state and federal dollars to build an ecosystem of community safety through communityled strategies we do so because we are grounded in the lived experience to know that doing nothing has never been an option for people who look like me in my community   60112 pm  doing nothing has not been an option for communities affected by gun violence thank you for continuing to meet the moment and resourcing the city of austin with the violence prevention and cvispecific support we look forward to continuing to to increase the collective efforts to build this ecosystem of public safety thank you  applause   hello thank you mayor adler mayor pro tem alter and city councilmembers for proclaiming june as gun violence prevention month in austin my name is robin breed and im a mother of two and a  volunteer with the local chapter of moms to action for gun sense which is part of every town for gun safety the largest prevention group in america june is also national gun violence awareness month a time to demand a future free from gun   60212 pm  violence and honor the 110 americans killed by gun violence every day in this country the world is watching what is happening in the aftermath of the tragic shootings in uvalde and buffalo and we cannot look away from the pain and the heartbreak that we are all feeling we applaud the efforts that the city and local leaders have taken to prevent gun violence in austin and save lives for example the gun violence community meeting yesterday it was a positive step in communicating across organizations to reduce gun violence in our city but we also know that in many ways your hands are tied by state preemption laws so it forces you to be innovative in the wake of mass shootings and daily gun violence that ravages our communities we must tell our state and federal lawmakers especially those in the us senate its time to do your job we are calling on the senate now to take real meaningful action   60313 pm  that will save lives from our fellow austinites i say dont look away from the tragedies that have recently happened our country is experiencing a gun violence crisis and we cannot let our lawmakers continue to do nothing gun violence is now the number one cause of death for children this cannot be our new norm we deserve better our children deserve better and its going to take all of us to enact meaningful change thank you again to the city of austin for doing your part to help end gun violence thank you  applause   thank you everyone for being here and to be part of this im nicole golden the executive director of texas gun sense were the only prevention nonprofit organization founded here in texas we have been fighting on this issue for nearly 10 years we were founded in the wake of   60414 pm  the sandy hook school shooting and i became an advocate at that time i know that many of you may be wondering  you may feel right now that this country is broken and i have been there and thats what made me stand up to be involved there is a system that is broken when something is broken it calls us to stand up and to be fixed it and thats what i have been committed to and texas gun sense is committed to we work primarily at the state legislature applying pressure there and letting them know that inaction is not an option and that we have a crisis that requires them to act immediately and we  also work in communities we work to end gun violence the daily gun deaths that you dont often hear about  suicides and deaths that disproportionately impact communities of color and intentional shootings and domestic violence gun violence has a lot of faces and were here to apply strategies to end all of those the meetings that took place yesterday that i got to participate in really gave me hope that even though we  we have a long way to go with the   60515 pm  legislature to see the change that we need to end this crisis communities like austin with leadership from mayor pro tem alter and her colleagues here at the council and garza and others locally are banding together to  to have a coordinated effort to end gun violence here in our community where its happening the most i think that it could be a model for other cities and im here to do whatever i can to make sure that that  that spreads all across texas it also sends the message to our state and federal lawmakers that were going to act even when they wont and that this is what our communities want and deserve and were not going to wait so i really really thank my friend mayor pro tem alter and shes been committed to this for a long time and i  and im so  hopeful to stand with this group which i think that shows the growing intersectionality of the movement and something that im committed to at texas gun sense and im you know im hopeful and were going to keep moving ahead so thank you for honoring gun   60616 pm  violence prevention awareness month today  applause   60800 pm   come on up thank you   good evening everyone my name is mackenzie kelly and im the city council representing district 6 in far northwest austin and today im presenting something pretty special im actually really excited about this one we are presenting a distinguished service award to officer scanlon presented by me i had the honor of knowing officer scanlon for a few years even before i was elected to represent district of but her action at the police department started before i got to know her the first citizens police academy was launched in orlando    60902 pm  in 1985 and the idea spread throughout the united states reaching austin around 1987 since then more than 2700 austinites have completed aepds course and i happen to be one of those that completed the course and completed the 1 100thth with officer scanlon as the lead instructor during the 14weeklong citizens police academy i learned quite a bit about what the police department does and how each department is integral to the overall success of the mission of the austin police department i got elected by my peers in that class as the class president which was a surprise to me i didnt think that anybody liked me but  but with that came the opportunity to give a speech at graduation which i had never spoken in front of a group that loud so it was very nerveracking and officer scanlon actually had to approve my speech ahead of time now that im elected nobody   61003 pm  reviews my speeches i get to say whatever i want but i can say that officer scanlon was able to give me feedback that i carried with me into what i do here today for that i am eternally grateful its clear to me that with officer scanlons retirement the police department is really at a loss as we celebrate this momentous occasion so on behalf of the austin city council i want to present this distinguished service award to officer scanlon and ill read it out loud for you officer scanlon is deserving of public acclaim and recognition for her dedication to the austin police department and the citizens police academy having served for 20 years as a police officer for apd and the driving resource behind the academy officer scanlon is the personification of a public servant this certificate is presented in acknowledgement and appreciation thereof this 9th day of june in   61105 pm  the year 2022 and it is on behalf of the entire city council but it is signed by the mayor of our great city so please join me in applause and recognizing officer scanlon  applause   and you want to say a couple words and before that i want to acknowledge that we have past graduates of the program here today behind us in support of this but if officer scanlon would like to say a few words   thank you my only regret this evening is that im not wearing our uniform right now i am retired but i would just like to say thank you to the mayor and council and thank you councilmember kelly for initiating this award and for acknowledging the citizen police academy the citizen police academy is a program that fosters understanding through education and it helps to build rapport and relationship  between the police department and the community members of austin it has been a privilege to serve as an austin police officer and   61205 pm  to wear the uniform and im proud to say now that i am a retiree with 23 years of service under my belt i have greatly valued serving as the coordinator of the citizen police academy and working closely with so many participants and community members and all of the folks here this evening are representative of the alumni for the cpa the program would not have been as successful without the efforts of all of these community members volunteering for cpa sorry i lost my spot i hope to be able to consult and to assist with cpa in the near future and i look forward to seeing the program becoming even more successful in the future finally there are so many officers of the austin police department that do their job daily with servitude and excellence my hope is that the austin community continues to see more awards and acknowledgement like this one this evening presented by the mayor and council   61307 pm  thank you all thank you guys  applause   kelly thats my hope too and so well take a picture quick and get the next proclamation going   61421 pm   next if the hanberry family could join me   kelly thank you okay weve got everybody back here yall can come closer i dont bite  chuckle wow this is a very special proclamation the proclamation from the city of austin is one of the highest honors that can be bestowed upon anyone but before i get started i want to say happy birthday to   61522 pm  mykayla carpenter who is the sister of the individual that were presenting this proclamation in honor of her birthday was yesterday and its  this is near and dear to my heart because i attended middle  school with the hanberry family and that was what is now district 6 when i learned about their familys loss it was very heartbreaking and as such i wanted to bring forward action which is why im bringing forward this resolution today and presenting it to the family in honor of ben hanberry i could think of no greater way to show honor to bens memory than doing this and ill just read the proclamation here it says proclamation be it known that whereas loyal are those who enjoy being around the majestic scenery that nature provides us to experience and whereas observations of such exquisiteness is only accompanied by the enjoyment of   61623 pm  our natural springs waterways lakes and oceans and whereas various outside activities are enjoyed by millions of people each year allowing for the experiencing of such beauty and whereas existence of safety measures while enjoying our environment is one of the utmost of importance for those in our community and whereas broad landscape should be accompanied by broad safety awareness and whereas embracing this empowerment is how we will remember benjamin james hanberry and whereas notoriously known for his love of family smoked brisket and music and natures waterways and whereas this proclamation will serve as a memorial to ben and a reminder to those that will also enjoy natures beauty and now therefore i mackenzie kelly austin city councilmember for district 6 along with the other   61723 pm  councilmembers and the mayor of the city of austin texas do hereby proclaim june 9th 2022 as water safety day in honor of ben hanberry id like to show something very special about this proclamation to the family in drafting it we were able to put a message from ben in there and so every other line if you look at the first letter of the word that starts the proclamation sentence right below whereas it spells out love ben and i have never been able to do something like that before and i really wanted you all to have it as a special memory of how special ben was so absolutely if someone from the family would like to come up now so that i can dry my eyes and well find some tissues thank you for letting me do this   thank you we miss bens explosive laugh the way that he made us each feel unquestionably seen and his presence at every family   61824 pm  gathering theres nothing that could ever make losing ben worth it but being able to give our pain any sort of purpose and possibly keep others from feeling the same pain helps to soothe that hole that has  been left in our family an excerpt from a poem reads so when all that is left of me is love give me a way were honored to be able to give part of ben away with this loving reminder to stay safe out there on the waterways even the familiar ones   kelly thank you  applause you want to take a picture okay lets get a picture   61939

that motion council member kelly seconds discussion those in favor please raise your hand those opposed unanimous on the dais with council member harpermadison   71534 pm  off again we are looking for things that will be resolved like really really quickly council member vela you think number 3 is in that group   vela i believe so   mayor adler lets call item number 3   vela okay if  mr snipes   good evening mayor council    vela just want to clarify this administrative change is just to  if you could briefly explain the administrative change that item number 3   sure i think theres a bit of confusion around the intent and purpose of that particular item it is only an administrative change it does not change service   71634 pm  delivery at all basically what we had or discovered as part of our work is throughout several of our documents code and administrative rules we refer to the same practice or same topics using different language and were just chewing up the language for example in this case city code 15611 refers to the break between what city services cover in terms of multifamily dwellings and what the private sector covers as five or less administrative rules say 1 to 4 dwellings were applying consistent language   vela with regard to the fourplexes  i know weve had discussions with the dumpster service some of them get i was wondering does staff have the video if you could show it on the screen  1001 browny   71737 pm  there we go right now  and i believe on ray burn right now  austin resource recovery is servicing those with the dumpsters in the picture right now   that correct as part of the work were doing to review those particular communities we are looking at options to remove the dumpsters by switching the communities to court service so they can  cart service so they can take advantage of recycling   vela i understand you started a pilot program close to brownie with regard to recycling youre providing recycling canisters now   that is correct we started the pilot in december of 2021 this will be the sixmonth mark for that particular pie plot   vela how is it going   its going extremely well   71837 pm  the residence have a low contamination rate which is something were proud of theyre putting items in their carts which are recyclable    and if staff could walk us  brownie  i wanted to show council you know there are fourplexs  youre going the right direction there you go theres another one and honestly most of these right now that were capturing  its a good day for them where theres not a lot of trash surrounding them often times that is blocking the sidewalk right of way  thats a common situation lot of times people will throw old mattresses and tvs they see the dumpsters  its an on going concern this is in district four and i wanted to highlight that aspect i know its not necessarily related to the item but i know weve been having on going   71938 pm  discussions and i would appreciate austin resource recovery as quickly as possible moving those fourplexes over to the can its a negative symbol to have the dumpster it just destroys the character and i think it really kind of creates an environment where you know a lack of respect really  kind of a lack of dignity for those folks anyway thats a good one we can see a bunch of trash around the dumpster its a difficult situation and i wanted to highlight it and i appreciate the pilot program there on san rayburn and i would encourage austin resource recovery to move them to the cans everybody uses one final question  on the fourplexes are they served with cans   some are some arent a fourplex like this where you   72041 pm  see a quad or bank  if we supplied carts that would be three per unit for a pod of four thats 48 carts you would have on the street on collection days so were kind of working our way through that trying to figure out how do we get customers to share carts as we move to a program like that one quick note about this is that to address the issues with blight in these communities we have increased the collection service in these communities from twice per week to three times per week and then weve doubled both collection as well in these communities from twice per month to once per week as well to help address the issues with the blight as we look at the cart program   vela thats all i have thank you director snipes i appreciate your information and your efforts and with that mayor i would move passage for item three   72144 pm   mayor adler second on item 3 council member tovo seconds that any discussion we still dont have council member harpermadison with us she has technical issues i think and was trying to get in shes asked us not to wait for her i think shes still going to be trying though so take a vote those in favor of item 3 please raise your hand those opposed now on the dais with council member harper madison off all right colleagues were going to reconsider item number 79 in the findings number c  item c said the district desire to extend as amended by five years  thats where it stopped should have first amendment not included   72244 pm  were going to reconsider as to add first amendment to complete the sentence there is motion to reconsider item 79 council member tovo makes the motion council member renterria seconds any discussion those in favor of reconsidering raise your hand its unanimous council member harpermadison is off item 72 adds a first amendment at the end council member tovo makes a motion council member renteria seconds discussion unanimous on the dais with council member member harpermadison off what about item number 10 at this point is that going to take us a while i dont think it will well be public hearing 81   72347 pm  we have now had says conduct a public hearing and approve a resolution  that revolution is what  i mean resolution   we will not be a revolution it will be a resolution   mayor adler is that number 10   for number 81 i respectfully request the mayor and council to take up 81 for the public hearing so we can consider item 10 after the public hearing   mayor adler right 81 is to conduct a public hearing is

district with new geographic boundaries teched is to aprof  now you have me doing it  approve a resolution authorizing down tun public improvement district designaing the downtown alliance to be the entity   72549 pm  state law requires council hold this hearing to give the public an opportunity to comment notice is required by state law and was mailed to property owners and published in the austin american statesman council created the district in 1983 and designated the austin alliance as the management entity it has been authorized three times and the boundaries have been incrementally expanded over the the years of the request of the property owners todays action was triggered last march the clerk has certified meeting the state requirements in april without council action the downtown public improvement district expires on october 11 2022 the owners petition to continue the downtown public   72649 pm  improvement district structured as similar to in the past assessment right of 10 cents per 100000 in assessed value the exemption on the first 500000 of value of all properties liable for assessment exemption of homestead civic nonprofit and religious properties and as the downtown austin reliance as the management entity per petition council would consider item 10 for approval to negotiate and execute a management agreement with the downtown austin alliance for a period of five years if there are any questions ill be happy to answer them if not were ready to open the public hearing and we do acknowledge that that conversation would be  staff would be open to negotiate the   72749 pm  contract the management service contract and bring back the contract for consideration to execute just wanted to acknowledge that conversation   mayor adler to clarify  just a couple of things first is we opened the public hearing this morning and opened it at 1000 oclock and we called everybody who signed up to speak just to double check is there anyone here who did not speak when we had speaking privileges that wishes to speak on this issue hearing none as part of the resolution well close the public hearing so is the resolution associated  forgot item 10 which well get to in a second but focusing on item 81 are we approing an  thor  approving a resolution that authorizes the downtown public improvement district to be the designate  and designated austin dmo inc   72851 pm  doing business as downtown austin alliance to be the management entity   correct   mayor adler is there a second to the motion to approve that resolution together with the closing of the public hearing council member pool makes that motion is there a second council member renteria seconds those in favor raise your hand it is unanimous i may have counted wrong council member tovo how do you wish to be recorded   i mentioned  council member harpermadison is here   mayor adler good to see you   i filed an affidavit with the city clerk im a manager of  at the advice of law im rekuzing on these two items mayor pro tem   72953 pm   alter have we voted on 80   mayor adler im trying to call the vote on 80   81   mayor adler 81 rather council member tovo is recusing herself item 81 appears to be unanimous this is authorizing the entity and the  identifying the management   as well as the creation of the actual pid   gidseg    mayor adler it closes the public hearing my count was unanimous with council member tovo rekuzing herself that passes lets go to item number 10 okay yes mayor pro tem   alter as i understand item 10 it is a management agreement   73053 pm   and they are still writing that my request is that we move to just negotiate which doesnt slow anything down and have them come back with the management agreement for our approval for execution   mayor adler staff okay with just authorizing negotiation without execution seconded by council member kelly any discussion i would raise the issue something on this has been pointed out to me that i havent been able to follow up on so i want to discuss in the negotiation and explain to council we had the homeless wellness center partnership that the da has initiated that was being supported by this certainly the da is doing a lot of great work with respect to homelessness in the downtown area but id like to know what   73154 pm  happens to that initiative as well as the other initiatives that the da is taking with respect to homelessness so were able to elevate and celebrate those efforts   mayor if i may we have representatives from the downtown austin alliance that can address that question if you would like or highlight that perhaps in a memo   mayor adler that would be fine im asking when it comes back before we vote id like to see that i dont think we need to do that tonight we have a lot of things on the agenda im just identifying that as an outstanding issue   sounds good   mayor adler yes mayor pro tem   alter i wanted to negotiate not because im expecting a problem but it seems with respect to transparency this is a lot of money that will be spent in our downtown and were dell grating a lot to  delegating a lot to this pid so i think its   73256 pm  important we see management agreement when it comes back thank you   well do   mayor adler okay take a vote on item number 10 those in favor raise your hand those opposed im showing it to pass 100 with council member tovo recusing herself   thank you   mayor adler okay thank you all right colleagues what else do we have thats fast    73357 pm  is 14 fast the garage question   i think 59 would be fast we havent done that yet   i agree i think 59 should be fast   mayor adler say that again   59   i agree i think 59 should be fast   mayor adler lets do 59 council member ellis do you want to make a motion   i move passage of version 2 of item 59 that incorporates amendments from mayor pro tem and council member fuentes   mayor adler okay council member ellis moves passage of 59 which is incorporated the fuentes and altar amendments is there a second any discussion those in favor please raise your hand those opposed im showing that as being unanimous on the dais 59 passes council member tovo are you set on the garage 14   73457 pm   i think i am first ill move passage   mayor adler is there a second to the motion item 14  council member vela seconds that   i had an opportunity to sit with real estate and got additional information there were a couple of interesting elements of this i wanted to point out and i would ask and have asked our real estate staff and am asking the city managers to make sure this information is provided in the future so as part of their newly negotiated rent they are getting two months free and part of that is because of the existing standing council resolution which ill provide direction if my colleagues support me to stop making abatements on rent because that was really intended on city property that was intended to help out the businesses that were on cityowned land during the height of the pandemic cook book was one wild about music was another   73601 pm  apparently our hostel was unfortunately not one around which there was communication as many of you know after decades of operation they went under and are no longer on cityowned property so the   in any case i want to make sure that the direction  if thats the will of this council that we no longer ask that your city staff understand were no longer abating rent agreements i think in the future we should have some stopgap so there were  when this  the term actually started about 18 months later than was authorized by council or then was expected by council so this is a tenant that has been  im glad to have them there but they have gotten you know an ability to start many months after it was intended to start they got two months rent free their contract like others   73701 pm  was needed a unilateral  they had an unilateral opportunity to extend thats changing which is a good thing if anybody is interested in working on the real estate issue with me  i think a couple of you have expretsdzed interest  make sure the lease comes to council make sure we have a clear sense of the tenant when theyre going to start paying rent and if that is not met you know that theres something else happening we cant afford to have our properties standing empty as long as as sometimes they are when were expecting to get rent for all those areas and we need to stop having unilateral ability to have extensions because that has prevented us from keeping up with the market on our cityowned property ill leave it there for now but thats  i also think for our convention center properties we need to particularly look at shifting the paradigm where were not just looking at   73801 pm  leases that support convention center visitors but were looking at how those uses can help us transform those areas so that those quadrants of downtown become places where austin residents want to go as well so all the uses in the convention center properties are not just supporting our convention uses my intention was that you wouldnt have to stay i apologize if youre here for this item with that ill conclude   i want to clarify the direction is were not doing abatements the rest   thats right yeah the direction is that we no longer  we no longer provide abatements   alter okay thank you   and that  i mean i had mentioned earlier i would be   73903 pm  making a direction today that leases come to us but i think that is the current practice so thats fine and were not opposed to it anyway is my guess    mayor adler all we have in front of us is this particular lease yes council member kelly   kelly just to clarify and for my own understanding its no more abatements on the current lease but youll bring something forward in a future resolution to not have abatements in future real estate transactions   the abatements are more general during the pandemic we passed the resolution asking staff to work on city owned properties on different kinds of arrangements that would allow them to stay as tenants staff have continued that now for all this time what im providing us by way of direction is to say please stop because were out of place where those businesses are allowed to be open and functioning we no longer want to abate rent based on the council resolution   74005 pm  that was meant to be an emergency measure during the pandemic   alter i guess that predated by time on the dais but my question to legal  were only posted for this item  does that apply to all the agreements or will that need to be in a future resolution   thats a great question we have a resolution directing city staff to do something well need a resolution to stop it sometimes we have sun set provisions in them this does not so i think youll bring back several different items and that will be included in this the direction youre giving today is to move forward with this item stop the abatement of rent   council member tovo if you would like to include me i think what youre trying to present is worthwhile and would be of great value to the city and i support it thanks   mayor adler really what we have is patsz ingpassing this item and acknowledging youll bring a   74106 pm  resolution to end the practice of the abatement and other items as well   i think weve sent a strong message to our staff that we dont want to continue that so hopefully that will be sufficient until we get to ifc   mayor adler okay ill join you in getting that and probably should do that as quickly as we can so they have authority to stop those in favor please raise your hand item number 14 please raise your hand those opposed 14 passes unanimously okay do we anticipate a long time on the asmp amendments   i dont think so   mayor adler you think that might be fast im indiscernible we have on    74208 pm  that okay lets hold that for one second i think its going to be several different things what about on 56 and 57 which are the parking   that will be fast colleagues on 56 57 i passed out an amendment sheet which is basically added direction this would direct city council  council direct the manager to conduct an engineer ng study and extend speed limit reduction on east slaughter lane and also like to include the addition of  and on bradshaw road if we can add on and on bradshaw road that would include a school in the etj this is important because what weve seen  especially for districts like mine we have segments of the road that are city and segments that are county and it reverts back to city and in particular this is east   74308 pm  slaughter lane and we have two schools that are in the county etj that deserve and desperately need speed reductions and so this would direct staff to coordinate with travis county in taking a look at reducing our speed especially given that a portion of the segment will receive a speed reduction   mayor adler okay so the motion is   do you want me to read it out again   mayor adler no the motion is as read is there a second council member renteria seconds it any discussion mayor pro tem   alter i would like to ask legal or  my understanding is that we have to do the study and the study determines whether we can reduce the speed we cant just  like by state law just change speeds because we want to so im wondering if   74409 pm  it would be better to say consider extending the speed limit reduction did you want to speak to that   yes maam you are correct richard mendoza  yes all speed limits have to be set by city traffic engineer and a result of a traffic study we have conducted a study on this road and have forwarded some of the results to our county counterparts and look forward to partnering with them onslaughter lane   so does our study say it should be reduced im wondering if we have to change the language to consider so youre not bound to do something you cant do based on the study    im going to ask my traffic engineer who conducted the study and oversaw the work to come up and address that question please   good evening austin transportation  just as a clarification the city   74512 pm  did not do our own study on those two segments of the county so it would ultimately be up to the county to conduct their own studies but we could work with them for the reductions that youre seeking   yes to my understanding they should have conducted the study this year or are they committed to doing it early this year im not sure where theyre at but i know   we can follow up on that we did our study within portions of the city limit but not the short segment   mayor adler lets focus down whats the verb in your deal and is it the right one the resolution is doing what   it says to coordinate with travis county to conduct an engineering study and extend the speed limit reduction on east slaughter lane   mayor adler can we authorize the extension at this   74613 pm  point or do we have to wait to authorize the extension   if delaying is the intention to work with the county to do their own study  that language can be interpreted that the city does its own study and   the county has committed and i know is in the works of doing their own study   right   mayor adler i dont have the wording in front of me i think the question is to do the study seeking to extend or was to extend a separate thing that were authorizing at this point   or to support the county in its efforts to lower the traffic speed limit because i think the point here is we dont have the authority to lower the speed limit ourselves but we can by resolution support the countys efforts to do that very thing because we would like them to do it   sure this language was shared with    74714 pm  transportation staff in advance but im happy to make changes so the intention here isnt lost   mayor adler would you read it one more time just that first part   directs the city manager to coordinate with travis county to conduct an engineering study and extend speed limit reduction    if i might offer that were actually supporting the county doing that speed study   mayor adler i think it may be more than that though who ultimately extends the speed limit   if its in the etj that would be the county to do its own studies im  the bradshaw addition is new to me i dont know if we want to add the specific extents of bradshaw or leave it   its the countys portion of bradshaw   mayor adler right now were  the resolution says lets coordinate conduct a   74814 pm  study and extend the speed limit i dont know that that is wrong   it indicates that we are  well okay if we are developing the intention here that city of austin is not doing the study wu besupport and  but we support and will coordinate with travis county as they do the study because were not putting our staff or expenses in the study i think thats the bright line here   i think youre right we have relationships with the county and can certainly work with them and explain our procedures and if needed for the county   mayor im sorry to bring up a can of worms but my question is it says were extending the speed limit reduction which i believe by state law you cant do unless the study shows that so  and so    mayor adler is it as   74914 pm  simple as just saying city council directs the city manager to coordinate with travis county to conduct its engineering study to extend its speed limit reduction   sure   mayor adler city council directs  is this okay with you    if that makes everyone more comfortable and if the intention here isnt lost i understand its a complex issue there are segments of slaughter lane that are city county and city the city has conducted our study and were changing our speed on our portion of the road we know travis county has their own study that theyre working on  is just trying to coordinate with them to make sure it gets done in a timely manner   right   there are two schools in the county portion that need the speed reduction desperately im happy with changing that   mayor adler if its both  if youre happy lets change and to its and   75017 pm  change and to two   fuentes perfect   mayor adler is that okay any objection to the amendment hearing none that amendment is made its been moved and seconded to pass items 56 and 57 as stated and amended yes mayor pro tem those in favor please raise your hand those opposed its unanimous those two pass thank you   thank you   mayor adler council member kelly you pulled item   57  i didnt mean to pass 57 i wanted    mayor adler okay   did we already postpone it i thought we said we were going to postpone it and council member kitchen had questions   mayor adler we did not so   i would like to postpone that    mayor adler let me call the item differently   75117 pm  because theres confusion about what i was calling and not calling council member fuentes offered the language on item 56 as amended lets take a vote on that those in favor unanimous on 56 lets call up 57 you want to make a motion on 57 or do you want to let council member  council member  fuentes makes a motion council member kitchen seconds the motion you want to address it before i ask council member alter  let her make her motion to postpone council member kitchen   kitchen i mentioned earlier i had a question on it but i got my question answered so im okay with proceeding with it   mayor adler okay mayor pro tem is   alter so i would appreciate postponing until next week i had three streets that were on the original map as having   75218 pm  speed reductions that are now apparently not having speed reductions and i need to understand that better   mayor adler okay   kitchen can i ask a question about that   mayor adler yes   kitchen im assuming you looked at the corrected map the reason i had a question is theres a map and corrected map in the background is your street not on the corrected map   alter the reason theres a corrected map is i looked at the map and resolutions and i had three streets in my district that were receiving speed reductions not in the resolution they told me they put the wrong map in   kitchen which streets   alter spice wood  indiscernible and lake austin boulevard i dont know what happened because i assumed there was a speed study that said they should be reduced and now theyre not being reduced so i want to understand that that was not something i was   75318 pm  able to figure out today   kitchen is it possible  maybe we dont  let me ask the staff a question   alter i dont think its going to make a difference one week if we  it takes them quite a while to     kitchen does it make  i assume the timing doesnt make any difference if we wait until next week right   no it should not make any difference   kitchen okay i assume it doesnt make any difference  i started to say why dont we adopt today what we have and then just add for next week but i guess it doesnt make a difference if the timing doesnt make a difference so  okay   mayor adler any objection to postponing this item until next week hearing no objection 57 is postponed until next week thank you i think that gets us then to item 61 council member kelly you pulled this   75419 pm  council member tovo do you want to make your motion   i brought forward a motion sheet mayor   mayor adler okay   may i make that motion it was circulated this morning   mayor adler its her ifc ill let her make her motion   that makes sense   mayor adler and then ill come to you council member tovo   i move approval please ill move approval with council member renterias amendment in it and i had some  let me leave it there apologies to him because i intended to have that as part of the base motion   mayor adler okay were there any other amendments that you incorporated in  im   75522 pm  not sure i have the    i have not distributed a new let me just say this i have not distributed a new version it is the version as in the backup and when you get to line 165 it would shift to council member renterias highlighted his motion  his amendment has highlighted language providing a little bit more details around that and im totally fine with that   mayor adler so its as you originally offered it with the exception that now it adds council member renterias language    yes   mayor adler its been moved second to that council member renteria seconds   75624 pm  that   i think i can accept a lot of the other amendments but we  if we could go through them bit by bit i had rewritten council member velas to the point i could accept those into the item two but he just distributed a new version that has some additional wording well in any case i can accept council member velas as i have rewritten it i think  ill let him explain what hes done but hes gone back to his original language and added in the word imprefsh yous cover in a couple of places   mayor adler i dont know how youve rewritten it unless i have the language   you have it in front of you i handed out a yellow copy a moment ago its stapled to a marked draft so you could see how i rewrote it and what the resulting   75725 pm  change is however he just distributed a new version of his and i can    mayor adler okay lets hold off    probably accept some of it   mayor adler ill give you a chance to read it while were not   i know where were going on it   has that been distributed   mayor adler im trying to give you time before we do that id like to know  you took renterias there was one offered by harpermadison ellis and me are you okay with that one   i have a date change to offer on yours but i believe  let me take a look at that again im okay with that but not okay with the final date of november 8 2022 and i believe we talked to city staff about an earlier date and i would like to   75825 pm  propose it be november    mayor adler no later than november 2022   yes   mayor adler okay all right i understand your desire to change that well check with others and then there was the vela amendment youre going to look at in a second and then theres a kelly amendment are you okay with hers   that one im going to need to find and discuss i looked at it and think i had some concerns but i need to find it here it is i have a question council member kelly can you help me understand what is  how does this differ from  what is your intent here is it to come back with recommendations whats the timing why dont you explain what your amendment does   kelly absolutely i had some questions to lead down this pathway ill explain it   75925 pm  when i read through the resolution i saw a lot of great things in it but it seemed to be a little resource heavy for me in the sense that i know that it will take a lot of staff time so i want to have that expectation of how much staff time it might take and i didnt know if you had talked with the city staff about how long it would take to complete this resolution so we as a council could have an expectation of some of the soft costs of getting this completed in a timely manner but also not putting too much on their plates i want it   sure i think that is a really important question to ask especially with a project like this and so my intent  mayor sorry to bounce backward but it was november 3 2022 to be clear and my understanding and i would ask our staff and i know that katie coyne is here and maybe others to verify this but most of the amendments that   80026 pm  were initiating  i will stop and put my hands down so that i dont break my microphone again so most of the amendments that were initiating are drafted and are ready to go and so because of the work that councilmember kitchen and others have already initiated most of that work is drafted were just saying please revive it and pull it forward ms coyne katie coyne   katie coyne environmental officer thats my understanding and recognizing that theres a huge amount of work that went into this and well need to visit with any data or new analysis that has occurred and going through the process of making sure that were engaging through boards and commissions but these are important amendments to code that we believe that we did have support four years ago and were looking forward to pushing forward    i appreciate that answer city manager have you had a chance to really go through and understand what it might take for staff to be able to complete and if the timeline that we have   80127 pm  outlined in this resolution will set up staff for success in returning it to us in the time that weve laid out or that councilmember tovo laid out   thank you councilmember we have much more to add than our environmental officer mentioned and obviously theres a big contingent on what happens today or during the deliberation process so there are additional things that do get added and we would want to come back and make sure that council is aware of what resources are used to execute that and if we are able to meet those time lines   kelly i think this is probably part of a larger discussion that id like to see us have on the dais about the expectation and the resources that were asking of the city staff when we bring forward resolutions just kind of holistically so that we do set up staff for success and were not overburdening them with different projects on top of the work they already have to do to make sure that the city runs properly   mayor adler and with respect to the data im okay if you guys are okay with this um and  but i want to make sure   80235 pm  that  and that im okay also with the november 3rd date and that other amendment councilmember tovo but i want to make sure that the staff gets down the land development code stuff that we ask them to come back in august and september that is residential and commercial and the compatibility and relaxation stuff got to be back in that augustseptember time frame so i dont want to do something that comes after that that makes it so that doesnt happen are you still cover with the dates   im comfortable with the dates   mayor adler okay thank you   mayor   mayor adler yes councilmember ellis   ellis thank you just very quickly and i know that things are moving along there but the agenda office is doing a great job of sending out some of the amendments and we have a number of them in backup if anything is handed out on the dais can i please ask that you send it to the agenda office as well so those of us that are remote can view it    80336 pm   mayor adler yes well make sure that happens   thank you   mayor adler okay so in that regard we were looking at  i think it was the kelly amendment so were speaking on the kelly amendment now councilmember kitchen did you want to speak on the kelly amendment   kitchen no i wanted to ask mayor if you had passed yours out because i cant locate yours   mayor adler yes it was posted item 61 has three councilmembers names in the upper righthand corner   kitchen did you pass it out because i dont have it   mayor adler thank you councilmember tovo all right so on the message board as well all right yes   tovo so councilmember kelly im not sure that what you have   80437 pm  heard from our staff is sufficient i would probably not incorporate your amendment just because im not clear on  you know we have  i have tried to make it really clear in the resolution that were expecting them to draw on their already completed work and i think that asking them  im afraid that asking the manager to come back with  from what i understand youre doing  you are asking the manager to come back with recommendations and considerations in a memo saying how many staff hours  so the next thing that would happen is not the work on getting this done and the next thing that would happen is that the manager is tasked with coming up with a memo estimating how many hours is going to be taken on the resolution but if we initiate it we have initiated it so it would just be creating another step for them to come back and tell us how many staff hours are coming back into it   kelly i appreciate that feedback but i would still like to have that accountability and your resolution is a good start   80538 pm  to that so as council we understand the time that were putting into those resolutions   tovo so when would you have the manager coming back    kelly let me pull it up right now it looks like september 1st but if theyre able to do that before then so that maybe as the work is getting completed id be happy to have the date changed   tovo so i think some of the work  some of the resolution work is coming back then so are you saying that it would come back  so the code amendments are supposed to come back to us by september 15th but two weeks before you would want the city manager to come back and let us know how many hours is going to be  has gone into it is that kind of thing   kelly it might be better if we asked spencer when it would be good for him to have a estimate of a baseline of how many hours so that the memo could come before the work actually starts does that make sense   tovo i guess that im still trying to figure out how that is useful if we have initiated    80638 pm  and given the direction to the manager to please go forward and do that work   kelly well im not asking to not complete the work i would just like to know with something that is this resource intensive for future decisions that we make its a good baseline to understand and to have that accountability for how much staff hours are going into the project i dont intend on topping the work for whatever reason because the work is important and the work that you put into the resolution to bring it forward is important and it will help our city how far i still would like to have that data point for future decisions that we make   tovo could it come back with the amendment  could the staff kind of track their time as theyre working on it so since its just within two weeks anyway could it come back with the code amendments and the estimate of how many hours they have taken   kelly is that something that you could do city manager   thank you councilmember if i understand your intent its really to project in advance just how much time this might be taking staff to complete and so after whatever version   80739 pm  might pass today we could quickly in a week or two come back with a memo so i dont think that we have to wait to september 1st to describe the effort that we anticipate that it will take and then if you want to do anything with that thats up to you but certainly we could at least signal what we understand is the time that it would require staff to execute on this resolution   kelly i think that would be great within two weeks if passing it   tovo will that delay the work in any way    no and the other thing that i want to say is that is just the projection of how much time it would take and i want to make sure that our staff can fulfill some of these other timelines that are part of the resolution so to that degree ill be relying on our staff and i would encourage our legal staff to also weigh in on if they think that these time to execute the actual resolution is reasonable at this point in time given everything else that youre   80839 pm  undertaking so trish is here to speak to that   city attorney to be quite honest in light of all of the current code changes that are pending it will be very challenging for city staff particularly the law department to make that november date because i realize that these are drafted as part of the ldc revision but theyre not necessarily drafted to incorporate into title 25 as it exists today so that will be something that we will have to work through and we will want to get it right and so just kind of in light of everything that we have pending i am concerned that the november date or anytime before november would be very challenging for us   so maybe to that degree when we finalize this discussion today we can come back from staff and saying here is what time we think that this might take to execute and if we need to request any adjustments to   80940 pm  the timelines that might be described here we will also be  well do that as well   kelly thank you and councilmember tovo with our discussion related to ads and there was back and forth as expectation setting and i think that as a council having that expectation set ahead of time so we understand what were asking for and when we will receive it so we can pay attention to that timeline and make sure that its followed on is very important to the success of our work here at the city   so i just want to clarify your change to the harpermadison ellis    mayor adler to november 3rd   two dates in the document so i just want to make sure that the other code amendments will still be coming back september 15th so as we have these   81042 pm   conversations just to acknowledge that we have i think four councilmembers who are going to be off the dais and i think that the december 8th date may be the last council meeting just so that staff have some sense of some of the ways that we may be thinking about things that you know when this amendment adds sort of a whole lot of other work to the original resolution its pushing it to the date then that we cannot postpone and the people involved in initiating the work is having an ability to vote on it and obviously it will take the time that it takes but i think that we do need to  we need to start thinking and planning and understanding that reality which i think that is a new one for us to have you know you you know for   81142 pm  members who will be term limited out you know i just think that well need to understand that and to factor that into some of our timetables for some things   mayor adler i think    tovo mayor if i may  i mean i am trying to  you know i have five sponsors and i believe that theres at least one other sponsor who requested being a part of this so to be really clear we had enough support to pass it there was a request to postpone it and we have come back im trying to embrace  you know im trying to get us to the final point here tonight so we can go home and we have a lot on our plates and to underscore what the mayor pro tem have said most of these add in additional steps and additional information and additional levels of analysis and frankly you know we have flooding situations that cant wait we have  i mean this is an environmental  this is a resolution aimed at addressing   81242 pm  some historic inequities in terms of how we protect the bodies of water east and west with a long history of a lack of protections for the bodies of water that are in the eastern portion of our city so these are really code amendments that should have happened years ago and they have been in progress for a long time if we load this down with analyses and additional studies and other kinds of things its going to take longer and thats not okay with me so you know again im okay with adding in some of these things but if that is what is pushing it beyond september then im going to say no to some of the amendments   mayor adler i understand so just to propose a way for us to move forward it sounds as if the direction that you have councilmember kelly is for the city manager to come back within the next couple weeks with the required city staff hours to complete this resolution   kelly thats correct can i ask city manager is that    81344 pm  something that you would typically do with any resolution anyway   yes   kelly thank you   tovowhen have we ever done it with all due respect we dont have things pass on the council agenda and then have a followup memo coming forward saying how many hours i have never seen that i have seen instances where the staff came back and say we cant make the deadline and we can make this deadline but its usually the point that its supposed to come back to council   so with this request and if this amendment passes then we would come back with that information   kelly sorry to clarify as you get resolutions do you make an estimate how much hours it takes for staff to complete with part of your analysis of completing the resolution is that already included in what you do   were always balancing the different priorities of council and the daytoday operations that are required with navigating   kelly thank you   mayor adler okay so i would propose that we let the manager come back the next two weeks   81445 pm  and its not going to take a lot of time for him to do it and he gets that done okay so hang on one second does anyone have an objection with that going in im sorry what   an amendment   mayor adler an amendment to this   i just want to ask that when you do that if you could clarify how much of that extra work has to do with the  the additional information related to the green fill conditions and the steep slope portion because i think that is going to be a considerably amount more work than the rest of it i just thank we should have clarity on that im not saying not to do it   mayor adler i dont have problem getting clarity on that too so requirement to assume that this other amendment goes in requires to you look at both of those so you can differentiate and councilmember tovo i also want the environmental stuff to move forward too and thats why the amendment coming from councilmember harpermadison and councilmember elis and me    81546 pm  specifically allows the bulk of this amendment to move forward on the timing that you proposed without changing the due date at all from september 15th but as luke testified here today theres a real concern that if we just do the green field without the balancing or   or mitigating elements of it all were going to be doing is basically just never having any of the  the large tracts ever change and were basically preserving them inadvertently and we tried to call those two out which were the ones that the environmental community was concerned about  the green field and the slope issues and said dont let this hold up the rest of the work but with respect to those two things come back and tell us how we actually make them work so that people will  will actually put   81646 pm  in the  the environmental protections that we want them to put in so it was with timing in mind that we drafted it that way robber but the manager if this passes and the manager as mayor pro tem would identify the timing anticipated for both of those two things and they were both done and we had the mitigating things that were also done in the code when we approved that they were both done so    kitchen mayor i have been having my hand raised for a while   mayor adler okay you have any further amendments to councilmember kelly before i ask    kitchen no but i have a question about the one that youre taking care of   mayor adler and lets take care of councilmember kellys first any objection with that going in made by the mayor pro tem   no objections just a brief comment that we have been throwing a lot of work at staff and just as a general matter i do support getting some kind of   81747 pm  idea of what is their capacity and so i do appreciate the councilmember kellys amendment and i think just as a general matter we need a realistic idea of what staff is capable of producing and when they can get it back to us i am talking to councilmember kitchen about it and a new item and i know that we had said  i cant remember  prior to me being on the council but i think we have to have realistic expectations of staff when were asking them to come back with all of these report for us    mayor adler any objection with that as amended by mayor pro tem hearing none that goes in and the next one was the one that came from ellis harpermadison and me the date on the last line is changed to november 32022 any discussion on that amendment councilmember kitchen   kitchen i have a question for watershed im not sure who to ask this question of but basically the  the question that i have is i dont have any objection to this   81848 pm  language but i want to make sure that in the process of doing this that the staff feels that they have the flexibility to really bring back something that looks at the whole picture i have been concerned about localized flooding particularly in westgate area in my district and so i know that the green field regulation could have an impact there and so im  although you know this language is written to  to develop recommendations that were offset the impact on affordability and capacity of requiring green field conditions as a baseline thats important but i also want the staff to also feel comfortable in the flexibility and coming back and saying but this is what we really need to address localized flooding for example so if you would like to speak to that at all   i can and i might defer to my deputy environmental officer   81949 pm  as well to dig in a bit katie coyne environmental officer i think that the future of an environmental officer for a city like austin cant be a single issue  person i think we have to evaluate all of these things in concert to have a more resilient city so im happy that were thinking more holistically about environmental code changes it is more work it is more complicated but i think that its a vital component of how we have a livable city for the future liz can speak to the green field items specifically if you want anymore details we have some data on specific local flood problem areas and some of the impacts that  the positive impacts we would see if this were in place and we are happy to expand on that but hopefully it answered your question   kitchen yeah if you wanted to speak to that   good evening ms johnston with osha protection you mentioned westgate and i believe that is one of the areas that our planning staff have   82050 pm   identified as a potential area that would benefit greatly from the detention  extra detention requirements that the green field requirement would bring forward so we have more analysis that we could provide you later but i do think that we do have the flexibility in this resolution to look larger and if theres anything new that comes that wasnt you know discussed that might help clarify things maybe streamline things but also help the localized flooding issues we will certainly bring that forward as well   kitchen okay great thank you i just wanted to make sure that  this language was interpreted in a way that was flexible so that  that were also looking at the need for these kinds of provisions related to green field   mayor adler any objection to   82151 pm  incorporating this amendment with that chainl from councilmember tovo hearing none this amendment is included have you had a chance to look at councilmember velas amendment   tovo i have and i think that its good that we have this conversation about timing and heard from our manager you know that there are other kinds of things that are also in the works of course we all know that and i think that councilmember vela after much consideration and im looking at this and from what i understand of what youre asking to do youre asking for an analysis of how  how the cost of compliance differ for singlefamily houses versus smallscale projects and larger middle and multifamily projects and then that youre asking the manager to recommend changes that would ensure the cost to comply is proportionate for different kinds  i think that is a level of analysis that is going to take some time i think that its somewhat out of the scope of what were doing here and i understand the way in which its related and why you   82252 pm  would have brought it forward but given our conversations around timing and the amount of time that its going to take to get these code amendments i would ask that maybe you consider bringing that separately as a different kind of ifc   vela i would like to offer it here and i understand that again we are asking more of staff but  and i understand the flooding concerns but we are also in a housing crisis and what  the number one problem in our housing crisis is that were taking singlefamily homes and were tearing down old singlefamily homes and building a new singlefamily home in its place and many of the reasons that were doing that is because the costs are so much greater to build lets say a fourplex or a sixplex than it is to just replace a singlefamily home a small singlefamily home with a large singlefamily home and i dont want to disincentivize the construction    82352 pm  of multifamily housing especially missing multifamily housing and as much as i support the flooding goals and all of those types of goals i do want to do that at the cost of increasing housing prices   tovo what are you specifically directing here i mean did i capture it in the be it further resolved that i  that i rewrote   vela what im specifically directing is that the city council initiate amendments and have the manager come back to provide recommendations to where were not disincentivizing the construction of fourplexes of sixplexes of that small missing middle housing that we need so badly because currently thats exactly what we are doing and that is the overall goal   tovo okay so i guess that id like to hear from my colleagues i think if theres a will to include this in here i would use my language  because i think that it just makes it very   82453 pm  clear what we are and are not doing for example be it further resolved talks about the council initiating code amendments but the other be it resolved explains what code amendments that were initiating and as i added yours i tried to focus on the action that i felt that you were initiating that was  the action that i thought that you were initiating which it seemed to me was about asking for  asking for what the cost was to comply with what are probably drainage and how it was different for different kinds of housing thereby not disincentivizing small scale and middle  but i am concerned this will prompt an analysis that is  that is going to take additional time and doesnt necessarily need to happen at the same time that were  for example making sure that  that were taking a look at green infrastructure and   82554 pm  some of the other things that weve had a substantial amount of conversation around making sure that were monitoring watershed threats from highrisk facilities such as sampling of creeks and looking at it downstream from industry i mean these are all  i understand  i understand your focus on trying to compare different kinds of housing and the different kinds of costs but it is  it is really  it is not related to the bulk of what we are initiating here   mayor adler so the manager is in the next several weeks going to come back with time issues so well be able to look at that when the city manager comes back and its a significant amount of time or  it pushes anything back well see that here in the next several weeks and then the council can start making priority  prioritization choices   tovo but at the end of july that would be our next opportunity to reverse action if we direct the manager to conduct an analysis of the   82655 pm  different costs of compliance for different kinds of housing which we may even have frankly we may have that in some of the previous work that has been done through time but i just  when we get that memo back from the manager were not going to have a council meeting and then by the time we do its the end of july   mayor adler im not suggesting that he stop working on things you know and the base work of this is the base environmental work i think that its an important thing to have  considering that id like to see it considered but im not ready to say that i want to consider this  that prevents us from being able to resolve the other issues i just wonder if that report will avoid us having to decide now not to including some for fear that we cant get it done when we maybe can get it done   tovo well i would suggest if theres a strong will to include this and again id like to hear from my sponsors because they were strong sponsorship  i would say at a minimum i would urge that we move forward with my language because it really focuses very clearly on what is being requested   82755 pm  and that we add in language like if it does not slow down the timeline   kitchen mayor i would like to comment on this   mayor adler hang on one second councilmember vela   vela so the difference virtually in the difference is to look at the code changes that are causing us to disincentivize missing middle multifamily projects this is not an academic look and this costs so much and this costs so much and lets look at the code and make the code changes   mayor adler looking at from councilmember tovo that the city councilor should look at changes that ensure  are we looking at the same thing   vela im looking at version five and her took out some of the language that initiated the code amendments    mayor adler her being resolved that the city manager shall recommend the city code changes that would ensure the cost to comply with water quality drainage and sites is    82859 pm  proportionate for smallscale missing projects and parentheses not disinvientzing the small scale missing projects in favor of singlefamily residences   vela so the last version that i passed out we added to it was instead of looking at the unit count which can be misleading looking at the impervious color i think that is a very neutral way of guiding your water quality restrictions whether it has five or six units or one unit it doesnt matter if its 5000squarefeet of impervious cover its 5000squarefeet of impervious cover and thats the most recent version that i have looking at her  i mean theres grammatical changes again i havent had a lot of time to look at  at hers and to quite digest the difference but i would prefer where we lay it out and identify the specific   83000 pm  problems involved in basically incentivizing kind of a singlefamily residence construction over missing middle construction   mayor adler councilmember kitchen on this topic where we are right now   kitchen yes on this topic so councilmember vela what i am hearing you say is that you feel that perhaps the language that councilmember tovo has may be missing part of what youre getting at is that what im hearing   tovo he did another version theres another    kitchen im looking at it   tovo so i rewrote version four and he handed out five i can  i can tell you how my rewriting of his would work it would simply be in the last one is to portionate to the amount of impervious cover instead of saying its proportionate  i think is   83101 pm  consistent with what you are trying to stay instead of saying its proportionate for singlefamily residences and smallscale missing projects and it would be instead now its proportionate to the amount of impervious cover thereby not disincentivizing    vela if we are trying to say the same thing i would prefer to use my language    tovo and i would prefer not to the more that you talk about if were going to use your language i need to understand what youre doing because for example in your whereas for it further resolved you are saying that the council initiates code amendments and im not sure what amendments youre talking about the ones that are initiated in the previous resolves or are you suggesting that the council initiate code amendments of some other sort   vela to ensure that the cost of compliance with water quality drainage and proportionate for the impervious coverage and in favor of singlefamily homes   tovo so youre initiating code amendments that would   83203 pm  ensure the cost of compliance  im not  what are those exactly   vela the code amendments that i am initiating for the city manager to determine i dont really understand   tovo so i guess  i mean i guess what might work councilmember to me that  that seems like a separate project to initiate  to ask the manager to analyze what are the  what are the elements that are disincentivizing the construction of singlefamily development at the expense of smallscale missing middle  come back and tell us what some of those elements are and then you would initiate based on those recommendations and you initiate the code amendments it would be initiating code amendments that    mayor adler i think that the concern is is that some of the environmental rules require action to be taken and the   83303 pm  action to be taken is tied to the number of units so i have the same amount of impervious cover and i have the same environmental impact the cost to comply with the environmental regs may be more expensive if i put four units in the house as opposed to saying that its only one unit and the staff is giving a thumbs up and i think that the question is why  its the same impervious cover and the same square footage and the same everything else why should the environmental compliance be four times as expensive thats the question that hes asking because then it just incents someone to put a single unit in it because its onequarter of cost and he says since its the same environmental impact and come back with ordinances or changes so would make it so that the same environmental impact is required to do the same environmental cure   vela very well put mayor    83406 pm   tovo so i guess  but yes as i look at my language  i mean i think that it doesnt  i believe that it is more or less saying that right the city manager shall recommend the city code changes that would ensure the cost to comply with water quality drainage and site plan requirements are proportionate to the impervious cover thereby not disincentivizing the construction of smallscale missing middle projects in favor of singlefamily residences i mean what we had was the city council initiates city code amendments and directs the city manager to provide recommendations for changes to the city code to ensure that the cost of compliance with water quality drainage and site plan requirements related to singlefamily homes and smallscale missing middle projects is proportionate to the scale of the project and does not disincentivize the middle projects in favor of singlefamily homes and including applying some water quality and drainage requirements to singlefamily development as proposed during the lvc revision   83507 pm   mayor adler for the life of me  i think that they mean  i think they mean the same thing because also what youre saying is to not disincentivize this is staff there can i ask the question  is it a different investigation  if we say hey dont penalize the missing middle projects and the fourplex in favor of the one plex if it has the same environmental impact does one language better point to that than the other language in your mind   i wish that we could just use the language that you spoke out loud that was most clear to me actually youre asking about the difference between impervious cover or topography   mayor adler i suggest that we dont want to be tied to just impervious cover at a really high level were just saying to cut to the chase  dont  give us options so that were not   83611 pm  disintercept vising missing middle housing in favor of single whether thats impervious cover or whether its units or whatever it is dont disincentivize fourplex if it has the same environmental impact   i think mayor what we wouldnt want to get into is an increase in impervious entitlements in an attempt to mitigate the cost of those environmental regs and thats our only concern of opening up that revenue and not being clear about the intent being equal impervious cover not regulating based on typology   mayor adler i think thats what he is saying so i dont think that you need to describe the language to look at and with equal environmental impact dont disincentivize missing middle housing    thats definitely the goal of the amendment   mayor adler changes that would ensure  so the city manager shall recommend the city code changes that would ensure   83714 pm  that  for the same environmental impact were not disincentivizing missing middle housing and let them decide all of the factors to take into account there does that work   if water    vela if staff understands the intent and is fine with the language that is fine with me   tovo i dont understand   mayor adler so to ensure for the same environmental impact were not disincentivizing the middle housing   tovo um   mayor adler for the same environmental impact as a singlefamily home were not disincentivizing missing middle housing   83815 pm  so to recommend the city code changes to ensure that for the same environmental impact as a singlefamily home were not disincentivizing missing middle housing that may be units that may be impervious cover i dont know but its  the commonality is for the same environmental impact and were not disincentivizing multiple units   that is the goal mayor   mayor adler yeah so that necessarily does not include more impervious cover because that has a different environmental impact it may get us there councilmember tovo   tovo i see councilmember kitchen  i will think about the language a little bit   mayor adler okay its 20 minutes to 900 and we could always pull this one off to next week and spend more time on language   tovo i would like to hear from my cosponsors whether that is their interest because you know flooding is  has taken    83917 pm  lives in this community and i think if were  i regard it as a matter of importance that we move forward as quickly as we can   mayor adler i think we all share that councilmember kitchen   kitchen so my question is  is the thinking that this analysis happen simultaneously or before the rest of whats going on here because im  i think that its  i think its a good question to be asked and certainly something that we want to analyze but again im concerned that it might hold up   i am concerned  i am not understanding how it would happen so because  as i said before im concerned about you know flooding and im concerned about a lot of other aspects of this and im hoping that this kind of analysis  the way that im reading it it should be  it shouldnt hold up the other things that youre doing but i   84019 pm  dont know so thats my question to you all in other words do you have to finish this before you can do any of the other things that we ask about   i dont believe so i dont interpret this as a formal cost analysis in the way that you initially started talking about it is looking at the regulatory burden across different levels of impervious cover but that would be part of what we would like at as part of the process anyway not a separate analysis   kitchen okay and again this is looking at that burden but also understanding the benefits that are needed at the same time   of course   kitchen okay   mayor adler i think that youd have to do it this way anyhow as part of the analysis mayor pro tem   alter so i think that the way that you framed it narrows it quite a bit from where we started when i look at the list of things that were initiating code amendments i mean i guess that it depends how you are defining   84120 pm  missing middle housing but if youre talking about triplexes and quads i dont know that its about supply because youre not having big detention pans  and if we are then we obviously need to  we need to address that i mean it depends on the number of units that youre having so  i would be  comfortable with that im not sure that theres actually that much that were  were regulating here for singlefamily  so i would be comfortable with that because i dont  i dont  but i do think that theres a separate conversation that we might want to have over that question that is beyond this resolution   vela mayor some of the  if we have a steep slope requirements and some of the other requirements that are necessarily going to limit the amount of land that can be used on you know particular lots and those requirements are typically not going to impact singlefamily homes the way that theyll impact multifamily you know missing middle projects   84220 pm  so thats why im offering it in conjunction with these regulations so it would act to offset any potential increase in housing costs of these regulations i understand that it could be a separate item probably each individual item in this item could be a separate item but i  i dont want the cost to increase for missing middle housing and the amendments offered to balance   mayor adler yeah i see  the green slope is an entirely different issue and were trying to incentivize people to actually used it rather than to not use it and youll have to figure out what that balance and what the tradeoffs are in that or else no one will ever redevelop the land or ever develop westgate so you have to come with something that gets that done because those are the really big things those are the hard ones to get done so its a different deal than this but in this were talking about the same environmental impact so as to clear up the question of what missing middle housing would be in this instance i would suggest that we add the   84323 pm  multiunit and so the missing and middle or the multiunit housing   vela so in the first whereas we have defined it as a project with approximately three to 12 units moip okay that is still in the whereas clause thats good so are people okay then we have kathie whereas clauses that carry forward that definition and the only change that were making is to be it resolved and the city managers ensure that for the same environmental impact as a singlefamily home were not    tovo mayor if i may i worked on a little bit separate language that for the same environmental impact as a singlefamily home the city is not disincentivizing and then pick up the rest and the direction of smallscale missing middle projects yeah   mayor adler much better    tovo and i would say that i think that we should have a different timeline on that because it seems to me that is not information  and its not  these are not code    84424 pm  amendments that our staff have currently drafted as far as im concerned i think that it is a separate  i think that it is a separate and an additional initiative and i would just ask our environmental    mayor adler lets check with staff because it seems to me that its part and parcel of the same thing is that a separate analysis   i think were happy to include it in the slight delay with the green field and    tovo okay   the components to give us a little bit more time since its an additional component but well be talking about all of this in tandem   mayor adler so the city manager shall recommend by november 3rd 2022 and then    tovo we could thought at the beginning by november 3rd the city manager  blah blah blah   mayor adler by november 3rd 2022 the city manager shall recommendation the city code changes that would ensure that for the same environmental impact as a singlefamily home the city    84525 pm   tovo does not    mayor adler does not disincentivize missing middle housing as we    tovo smallscale missing middle projects i used councilmember velas language smallscale missing middle projects and then just to back up to your previous  your previous be it further  well it was additional language to standing be it further resolved  councilmember vela  the one about providing information for the costs of compliance there i would just like to add too that  that too may be part of it but i would add the language if it does not slow the timeline   vela the timeline for the other changes in 61 again i would like them to be parallel because the effects are parallel   tovo it sounds like our staff have said that if its   84626 pm  part of the later  i dont know     mayor adler well need that information to be able to vote on it anyhow well need that information to be able to vote on the main thing   tovo which is already in the   its already in the resolution this is asking for  this is asking for another level of detail about costs and that is providing costs for different kinds of housing which i think that is part of what theyre returning to us already with the fiscal impact and whatnot   mayor adler for people that are concerned about that issue theyre going to want to have this information    tovo thats fine   mayor adler okay so with the changes that we just made it to the be it resolved clause the total version of vela before  okay yes councilmember kelly   kelly okay thank you i was looking at the difference between councilmember tovos language and councilmember   84727 pm  velas language and one is recommending city code changes and one is initiating code changes i was wondering if the city legal could explain if theres any differences in those two processes and what theyre defined at so the people at home watching or listening on the radio can understand   yes theres a difference that will help us there   in title 25 council initiates changes to the land development code and so without the word initiate they would go through the full process and with recommend staff would provide council with a memo a presentation that explains what they have recommended and after that point in time council could initiate if they choose to   kelly so then i guess with us having the timeline that we do and the fact that we are experiencing housing crisis i would be more comfortable initiating code amendments as   84827 pm  councilmember vela had brought forward because i think that would speed things up a little bit and help to get us to a place where we could have more housing   mayor adler any objection with having the city manager  by november 3rd 2022 the city manager shall initiate city code changes   tovo i dont know what were initiating we dont have any  any sense  of what were initiating    mayor adler it would be whatever  whatever ordinance is necessary to ensure that it doesnt cost more to build  with the same environmental impact that it doesnt cost more to build a fourplex than it does a singlefamily house   we would still have to have the item to come back to vote on correct   mayor adler yes but i think that its ample description to say if it has the same environmental impact and bring us back an ordinance that ensures that theres not    city staff can prepare ordinances that go with the ordinances that are already being initiated that will   84928 pm  address whatever concerns in this area   mayor adler thank you   we are authorized to do that   mayor adler okay mayor pro tem   alter thank you i just want to clarify because i dont want us to mix up two different things so i think that it is perfectly fine for us to say that the ordinances that were initiating that the ordinance changes that we are initiating that we dont want to disincentivize over the singlefamily and its another to get rid of the differential costs in our code between singlefamily and missing middle and im not saying that we dont need to do that but thats a different resolution than this one and its a different set of staff so it is  it makes perfect sense to say that as you implement these ordinance changes that we do not want to disincentivize the missing middle over singlefamily and its a totally different project to say that youll get rid of all of the differences that   85029 pm  exist in our code and site plan and everything else   mayor adler so are you saying that the city manager shall initiate  sorry by november 32022 that the city manager shall initiate singlefamily changes that would ensure and put in there that pursuant to ordinances here under that the cost comply   vela so mayor the resolution the whereas specify the water quality protections and thats what the focus of the amendment was really  the water quality protections   mayor adler the water quality protections as contained in the  in the larger item right   vela yes    mayor adler i think that goes without saying i thought but mayor pro tem is raising it specifically so i was referring back to it that the city code change that would ensure that these  these water quality   85133 pm  ordinances    mayor most of these ordinance changes do not affect singlefamily or    tovo perhaps i should lay out my amendment   mayor adler it doesnt have to pertain to it at all but it does some water quality and he wants it to pertain to the water quality work   so it should just be that when you initiate these you are not disincentivizing it and its not in this resolution   mayor adler correct we are trying to put it in the language that ties it back to you   but negotiating the ordinances and you already have ordinances that are initiated and youre trying to make sure that the ones initiated in her resolution to begin with dont disincentivize and youre not doing additional ordinances   mayor adler got it   kitchen mayor with all side of the respect this side of the dais would like to talk to   mayor adler im sorry im sorry   kitchen i feel that this conversation is happening over there   85234 pm   mayor adler i apologize that point is well taken im looking to my left   kitchen okay so i have a comment that i would like to make about  about the  initiating  so my question is  i have a bit of concern about saying that were going to initiate city code amendments because i really dont know what those are you know as my colleagues have already said i would like to echo that so im wondering is there a step in between here that  and the problem with that is that you know councilmember vela they may initiate something that is not something that you want you know if theres a process for initiating based on something that is this vague you may go through a whole process of initiation without you have a chance to weigh on what you want to be initiated and by the time that it gets to council it may not really address what you want it to address    85334 pm  so thats why its helpful to be a bit more specific on whats being initiated i know that you dont want to slow things down because we do need to initiate a process so maybe theres  you know theres a step in there somewhere that  that brings it back to council so that you can have some opportunity to comment before they go through the whole process with the planning commission etc you know   vela so im trying to balance out the fact that these are set and ready to go changes with the  the protections that i want to put on housing costs which kind of need to work in parallel you know i dont want there to be a bunch of changes water quality and water protection changes that will then raise housing costs and then staff comes back and says oh and by the way these are some recommendations about how we could balance those out without you know  i want to balance   85434 pm  those out and i dont want to just talk about how to balance those out or look at what we can balance i want them balanced and i understand that its a broad amendment where staff tell us how we can do this but were going to get a chance to look at it and the dais will be able to look at and to go through the same amendment process that were going through right now and ultimately you know we can get to a place that we have a bill that does all that we want to do which is to protect the environment and prevent flooding but not at the cost of increased housing expenses increased housing costs   mayor adler im trying really hard to get to a place here where i can vote for this resolution rather than voting no at the end of the day and im going to vote no if its only looking at one side of the equation and is not looking at the other side of the equation so im trying really hard to balance that out or im a no vote the initiated ordinances will ensure that for the same   85535 pm  environmental impact as a singlefamily home that the city does not disincentivize smallscale missing middle housing projects   vela im sorry mayor one more time   mayor adler the initiated ordinances will ensure that for the same environmental impact as a singlefamily home that the city does not disincentivize smallscale missing middle housing projects   kitchen mayor i think that does it because it initiates but it also is focused on the concern that councilmember vela said you know that these  that these other things that are moving dont end up disincentivizing    vela im good with accepting that language mayor   mayor adler let me read it again   tovo no read it again it sounded like what we had already put in there but read it again   mayor adler but hopefully different enough to agree the initiated ordinances will inn sure that for the same environmental impact as a   85636 pm  singlefamily home the city does not disincentivize smallscale missing middle housing projects anybody object to that amendment   tovo i think that is fine its very much in keeping with the language that councilmember renteria had add with understanding the fiscal impact that has been there and this adds another layer of detail and not initiating new ordinances and its simply saying to help us to understand the impact of those that we have already initiated   mayor adler trish did you get that language thank you all right so without objection tovo has changed to velas version four is included with the change to the be it resolved clause as i just read out loud continuing on are there any other amendments to this section   i want to clarify that   85736 pm  includes the whereas changes   mayor adler where is the whereas changes   theyre  i dont know if theyre changed    mayor adler the base document that i was working off was tovos changes to vela four except the resolve clause changed all right do we have any other amendments that anybody is offering to this one we ready to vote on it as amended those in favor of this item 61 as amended please raise your hand those opposed passes unanimously on the dais congratulations   tovo mayor i know that its late but i didnt have an opportunity to really speak about the resolution more generally and i simply want to just say thank you to my staff member who worked tremendously on this and she worked in concert with my colleagues who cosponsored it and with councilmember kitchen and staff and our    85837 pm  environmental officers and i really appreciate all of their work as well these are going to see forward some processes and some new regulations for ensuring water quality throughout our city despite what we have spent most of the time talking about  the resolution really addresses areas that are less  as mayor pro tem pointed out  that are really more about more general issues such as making sure that as we have industries with potential risks for polluting that were on top of that and were monitoring it closely that when there are levels of e coli noted in particular creeks especially in areas that theres better communication with austin water so that those pipes can be  be fixed more quickly theres a lot about green stormwater finally moving forward with some of and   85939 pm  making sure we have equitable  making sure we have equitable distribution and other  i appreciate those who contributed here and especially the work of atha   mayor adler lets move on to the next item were going to do item 52 anybody want to make a motion to pass the item is council member pool council member vela seconds it   i have a few quick questions for staff i think our  these are going to be legal questions so ill let transportation staff off the hook and call trish link whos been doing triple duty tonight hope youre not too worn out trish we heard from some of   90040 pm  the neighbors in my district specifically and some of the folks are still here  that theyre concerned about imminent domain and the impact of the changes to the austin strategic mobility plan  the updates to it that they would not have right of ways protected and so i had a couple of questions that i wanted to ask in order to highlight their concerns and then have them specifically addressed if i may do that with you just three questions so the first question in order to  im looking to confirm that people are indeed protected from imminent domain taking of their property specifically under the asmp does it as currently drafted open the door to taking private property without notice or proper legal procedures   trish link city of austin law department no council member it does   90141 pm   not we still need to follow the procedures and state law nothing in the asmp changes that   thank you what is to guarantee the city will follow the standard process for obtaining private property should we decide to do that   state law applies to our actions we will have to comply with state law and state law would not allow us to use asmp to bypass state law   city of austin is not in the practice of violating state law to the best of our abilities   to the best of our abilities   my last question  if it is certain the city will follow standard procedures for obtaining private property should we decide to do that why not write this in the code as some of our speakers have asked us to do sh   in doing that it creates  it will create confusion for the public   90242 pm  we dont write that in everything we do were bound to follow the constitution and state laws as they apply and we do that without applying to the code   those are the questions i had for legal and i appreciate trish offering those answers   mayor adler any further discussion of item 52   kelly i want to be respectful of colleagues participating virtually i know a motion sheet has been passed out and i want to make sure they have it as well so they can review it in a timely manner   im confirming that with my staff thank you   mayor adler whats been handed out is council member tovo has handed out on item 52 a motion sheet amended the asmp to add language how is this being made available to council members   90345 pm  ellis and harpermannedison   i will have to confirm whether its been emailed or not i can certainly read it in the meantime and that is   i would appreciate that or posting to the message board if easier than emails   and in the meantime ill read the language amending the asmp to add the following language in december 2012 from the regional transportation plan to align with goals of the imagine austin  comprehension plan reaffirm city councils position that the sh45 southwest is not part of the future transportation network and so thus  and this is the action  were directing staff to remove the reference to the uncompleted section between farm road 1626 and   90449 pm  ih35   mayor   mayor adler yes   i wanted to let our council members know that a virtual i text  that are virtual that i texted the amendment i know theyll get it in email but theyve also got it by text   mayor adler council member kelly   kelly i think its great they got the motion sheet but in the interest of   i didnt mean instead of i was just trying to be helpful   mayor adler is there a second to this amendment council member kitchen seconds it discussion council member ellis   ellis thank you im supportive of doing this at this point in time i know it was addressed with   90550 pm  the original adoption of the asmp ive been hearing from many constituents about the concerns about if this  the implication of it being included in the asmp at this point in time but the environmental damage and impact to the community that might happen if this roadway were ever connected i represent the area thats over the edwards aquifer in barton springs and were stuck in traffic already we need to be mindful how were connecting highways and managing expansion especially in environmentally sensitive zone i appreciate this amendment being brought forward   mayor adler any objection to it being included   thank you for bringing this forward i also think its appropriate because it reflects previous actions that the council has   90651 pm   taken its correcting the asmp to align with what we said   mayor adler staff want to speak to this issue   good evening cole kitten austin transportation i thought i would provide a little background about sh45  you know this amendment process didnt propose any changes to what was adopted in 2019 and in fact in 2019 we had the same conversation about sh45 and why its in the asmp so the language that was added in 2019 was about providing further guidance to the city to ensure that if txdot moves forward with the project that the city of austin would work with txdot to ensure its done   90752 pm  in the most sensitive environment  environmentally sensitive manner that language was added to the plan the map also changed the linework from a solid line to a dashed line to indicate that its being treated differently than the other lines in the street network map so that was the decision made in 2019 to keep it in the plan with the reason being that the street network is used for right of way dedication and reservation through the line development process just in case that property redevelops that line on the map indicates that that property cant locate buildings in the future path of that highway so its inclusion in the plan ultimately doesnt constitute a   90853 pm  commitment to build the roadway its solely in there for right of way dedication purposes my concern at the staff level is that if its removed from the plan a development could locate a building in that path and ultimately in the future if txdot moves forward with the highway project it would lead to displacement of whatever gets built there   mayor adler how was it treated in 2019   it remained in the plan instead of being taken out   mayor adler it was dotted   yes the linework was changed to indicate it was being treated differently that additional language was added to the map as well as to an action item so that staff followed guidance on how to treat it with txdot   mayor adler what was that additional guidance or description of the  what the   90956 pm   dotted line was   if txdot moves forward the city would work with txdot staff to ensure its done in the most environmentally sensitive manner   mayor adler council member renteria   renteria if the state decides to move on with it is there any way we can stop them from doing it   i dont believe so the previous section of sh45 from 1666 to loop 1 had a similar level of conflict with city policy at the time but it continued to move forward was constructed with additional environmental sensitivities and its being used as a model for how to construct a facility like that in a sensitive environment   renteria if we were to remove that and the state   91057 pm  decides to go ahead and build it will we have an input  any kind of input on that   right the city will always be a partner agency throughout the nepa process during the environmental analysis   renteria if we decided not to put it in the city and the state decides to go ahead and go forward with it will we be invited to participate   right we would be invited by virtue of being in the jurisdiction that its in   renteria thank you   mayor adler okay we have a motion amendment moved and seconded in front of us any further discussion mayor pro tem   alter so we want to stop if we make it more expensive with more expensive right of way that would help in my view   mayor adler okay any further discussion on this ready to take a vote   91158 pm  those in favor of this amendment raise your rand those opposed council member renterria abstains others voting aye passes any further discussion on the asmp mayor pro tem   alter i dont have an amendment i just wanted to thank staff for the hard work that went into this process theres been a lot of discussion a lot of questions and i think  i know that youve always been able to be present in my district in talking to my constituents when weve asked for assistance the the  the transportation planning can get technical quickly and can be confusing for the public but it is nonetheless important for us to be able to make sure that we can assure the future development as to contribute the appropriate right of way for our needs as a city and that we can plan our mobility needs a lot of the discussion over   91301 pm  the asmp has been about you know specific assignments of levels and some of those were adjusted as they needed to be through the process but there also were some significant amendments to the policy focus and i want to highlight a couple of those so i appreciate the inclusion of two new policies related to one future proofing our transportation infrastructure and operations and to improving coordination between emergency transportation planning the latter is really important for our wildfire prevention and preparedness work i was able to work with staff to update an action item related to disaster preparedness and emergency response coordination to better address the wild fire threat and better plan for evacuations i appreciate staffs efforts there so thank you cole and other staff who led this process   91403 pm   thanks i wanted to add my thanks to everybody in austin who engaged in the process with asmp and city staff  not just for the hard work but listening to the public in the first round of public input there were concerns that reclassification of level one to level two streets might misconstrue to allow the city to take right of way or private property in response the city removed street level reclassifications for streets in single family neighborhoods im also reassured by the input by our assistant city attorney that homeowners are protected by alreadyexisting statutes should the city try to expand rights of way i thank you all again for your hard work im ready mayor to vote in support of this item   mayor adler okay those in favor please raise your hand those opposed   91504 pm  any abstaining   renteria mayor i think   mayor i had a quick thing i want to say but im still voting for it   mayor adler go ahead council member ellis    ellis as council member pool was laying out things she was excited to see in this it reminded me for the call out for streets as places for people which is in line with healthy streets block party program play streets and living streets and is in line with council member pools shock the block program which i know people are still excited about im glad the transportation department has a forwardthinking mind set and im excited to see this included   mayor adler okay those in favor of the item  52  raise your hand those opposed unanimous on the dais 52 passes that gets us up to 66   91616 pm  does anybody not have it its been posted and circulated i have extra copies in someone needs one  indiscernible in case she cant find hers   indiscernible   mayor adler not a problem this has been posted available for a long time theres a red line that picked up many of the amendments that were offered to this item significantly  mayor pro tem want to lay it out   alter sure i was going to make the motion    mayor adler make the motion  mayor pro tem makes motion passing item 66   91717 pm  is there a second council member pool seconds it mayor pro tem   alter thank you so what we have before us is item 66 which is an opportunity for us to move forward to add increased density along our corridors recognizing that not every corridor is the same and allowing for us to tie changes in compatibility and parking with affordability and i think that this is a way forward that in providing three different types of corridors a light rail corridor larger corridors and medium corridors and allowing for that transition  i think this resolution sets us on a path to achieve many f our   91817 pm  goals that  of our goals that we share as a dais and does so in a way that i think is fair and balanced and im excited to see us take this step this evening hopefully    mayor adler thank you cosponsors anyone else want to speak to this theres  just for the record because i know weve talked about this there are certain roads and streets that the sponsors do not think are covered by the description of corridors that we have and we think those streets that are not contained within those corridors include east 11th street east of navasota east of 12th street 38th street   91919 pm  3812th street 48th street sh45 west of mopac bluff springs davis lane duval exposition fm 2222 light zero metric oltorf pleasant valley rosewood ross road south wood st elmo stack avenue terry road windsor road woodward street as we go through this i will admit honestly that from a policy perspective i would like for us to be going further on relaxing compatibility and   92023 pm  parking relaxing our requirements and i recognize that there are a lot of people in the community that would like us to go farther i also recognize that there are people in our community that would like us not to change the existing situation or change it significantly less but this has been an attempt weve talked about since earlier than november to try to come up with something that may be hard for us all to do but might actually be where the venn diagram crosses and allow us to move forward i think its more critical now than its ever been to increase density and housing on these corridors and i think we  thats our existential challenge and i hope were able to move forward with this and then i also recognize that   92123 pm  the orange line goes up gaudalupe i was asked about the question this would have in the district  hyde park area i checked with legal staff and confirmed my understanding within the district park 12 section 4 of the nccd it generally establishes maximum heights of 40 feet 60 feet south of 40th street additionally while exceptions exist maximum heights within the residential speedway are generally capped at 30 feet and staff will apply the more restrictive provisions in event of a conflict with base zoning regulations doesnt have a significant impact but to the depth of the tract on gaudalupe  i think   92224 pm   one of the larger tracts was 150 feet i just throw that out there and i hope that were able to make it at least this measured movement toward relaxing  toward contributing to housing supply in the city council member kitchen   kitchen yes mayor thank you i appreciate the effort that went into this and i appreciate the approach as you just described it i think that that was very helpful and i really do appreciate that i just have two questions just so im understanding this the first question is that  a minute ago you read out some list of streets and im wanting to just understand  is that by way of direction to staff that those should not be included   92324 pm  or im not quite sure what happens with that list of streets thats what im trying to understand   mayor adler i read it into the record because theyre not exceptions theyre just not the streets weve defined but to make clear so people in the community werent thinking that a street that was not in the identified elements might somehow or another be included  we had some challenges with that before the group decided not to include it because its really not an exception because its not one of the streets listed   kitchen but some of those are i think ill go back and look at the list and you read it fast but i thought i heard one that was an imagine austin corridor maybe i was mistaken my understanding is that what you did is you compared that list with your definitions and your understanding is that that list is not included in the definitions   mayor adler thats correct   kitchen okay my second question is then im   92425 pm  trying to understand the reference to the level five streets major highways because the reason im trying to understand that is because it has in parentheses major highways so i want to understand from staff that the staff will interpret this as level five parts of highways some major highways the access roads are level four and the highway itself is level five or there may be other aspects of these major highways that are level four and five mopac for example has level four and five i35 has level four and five and so does ben white im assuming  i want the  im fine with this i dont have a problem with it i just want to make sure that the staff is interpreting this as level five major highways just level five and to the extent that theres   92527 pm   level four involved this does not include the level four areas because thats what im understanding was the intent here   mayor adler yeah its level five areas level five highways   kitchen okay   cole kitten austin transportation level fives are in our street network map it is the highway system some level five highways do have frontage roads and those would be level fours   kitchen okay   so if you look at the map all level five streets include 620 360 183 and the like   kitchen okay but where theres access road thats level four this does not apply to those level four streets thats not what i understand the intent to be i wanted to clarify that   mayor adler why wouldnt you want  if its a level five highway and its on a level five highway i would think its included   kitchen its not according   92627 pm  to what youve written here and i dont think its appropriate na some places theyre level four for a reason in some places   mayor adler but frontage roads seem to be a different situation a frontage road on part of a highway is part of the highway are you thinking of areas where theres not a level five highway involved   kitchen i havent studied it i wanted to note there are level four areas   mayor adler if theres a level four area on a level five highway its not to be included   kitchen thats why i asked for the interpretation youre saying something different than what is written here this says level five i wanted to be clear that thats what were talking about   mayor adler i would think for all the reasons you would want it to be on level five you wouldnt want an intervening frontage road to displace that   92728 pm    madame council development officer austin transportation department if you include level five that will automatically include the frontage roads because if you look at our frontage roads there cannot be any frontage roads without level five or highways being there so if you note this as level five that will include all the highways   mayor adler the frontage road is part of the level five highway system   kitchen i want to note that there are places on the map that say level four maybe i dont  you know i couldnt zone in really closely to look at what those were so it sounds like what youre saying is if its part of the highway system its level five   that is correct   kitchen okay so i got that and in places where its  the mayor has confirmed that level five is the intent thats what i wanted to check okay   thank you   mayor adler okay   92828 pm  council member tovo   trying to understand a couple of the amendments that i think are new here today   mayor adler havent been offered yet   theyre in the version you just distributed   mayor adler youre not talking   revisions   mayor adler some of the changes in 66   so letter f it would exempt the following from compatibility regulations the second one is any building thats just residential that has a maximum of 12 units and a maximum of 35 feet in height that one i understand im trying to understand the impact of little i any use permitted in  youve got  trying to understand how use functions in here in any case it sounds like then you would have  so those are   92933 pm  also capped  those would also be a height of 35 feet but youre not specifying these are residential uses necessarily    mayor adler used as permitted in sf6   can someone talk me through the rationale is i need to understand what this does and why the inclusion and whats the impact on the value here   mayor adler i think this was council member harpermadisons proposed amendment that we incorporated and it was my understanding that it had a single family sf6 use  consistent with sf6 shouldnt trigger compatibility mayor pro tem   alter so i think both of   93033 pm  these were about not making  trying to facilitate missing middle in these areas by not requiring the 25foot setback for missing middle so it still has set backs that are defined on the chart that has the site development standards but it would allow the setbacks to be smaller depending on which sf zone it was so you would still have setbacks but they wouldnt be as large as the 25foot setback and so its allowing the missing  more missing middle to happen because youre making use of the setback and not requiring  you could have a missing middle  thats how scale even and it would have to be further away than if it was single family   93135 pm  thats how im understanding it   the setback in i would be governed  the setback you would use would be the one  say its sf4 for example the setback would be  lets see ive only got 4a from the rear yard  let me use sf5 it would be the rear yard set back of 10 it would switch to the site development standard regulation   alter right what happens is compatibility doesnt really matter because theyre all capped at 35 feet it only matters what the setback is in cases of sf6 or less what this is allowing is the setback of 25 feet not to  its allowing them to build in   93236 pm  that 25foot setback so the hundred foot distance et cetera  none of that matters because theyre capped at 35 feet in their zone   okay   alter we dont have any bonus programs or anything so its allowing the setback to not be 25 feet    okay   alter if you put a triplex or quad or  you would be able to build it only if it was on the corridors this only applies on the corridors   its any use not necessarily residential use there are lots of uses that are conditional or permitted in zoning categories up to sf6 that are not residential youre not specifying or  council member harpermadison in her amendment is not specifying its any use would be   93339 pm  permitted it could be community recreation other  anything pretty much on our chart local utility services it could be anything that falls within a use allowed in sf6 or more restrictive its not limited to  its not limited to residential   mayor adler i think this also provides that if you were building an sf1 or sf6 use  a use that was allowed in sf6 and you were building it in say an mf4 zone that that use because it doesnt trigger compatibility wont trigger compatibility so if its at sf1 sf6 use developed in a different category it doesnt trigger compatibility if its sf6 or less restrictive because that   93440 pm  doesnt trigger compatibility thats how i read the amendment   kitchen mayor   mayor adler yes council member kitchen   kitchen im wondering  i would think that the intent here is residential use so would it be acceptable to you to say any residential use permitted because what were trying to do here is allow for these missing middle if im understanding this correctly and so i think that  because see the double i is specific it says any building consistent of only residential units with maximum of 12 units its got that when i was reading this originally i was thinking the intent was that its residential is that not the intent   mayor adler i think thats the intent but i think residential has a more restrictive use  limited to three units   kitchen in sf6 you mean   93541 pm   it would give you at least six units would it not   mayor adler im not sure thats called residential   kitchen okay   mayor adler i think what the language said was any use allowed in sf6 or below   kitchen but it should be a housing use   mayor adler right   kitchen maybe residential is not the right term but any housing use is there  can we ask staff   mayor adler we can ask staff   kitchen yeah   mayor adler that might be okay   kitchen yeah   mayor adler residential with a little r im not positive it makes a difference but that was my understanding   i was going to see if mr rusthoven might help us   mayor adler that was the issue i dont want to accidentally use a fourplex and have it not count as residential   93642 pm   we have categories in the code such as residential civic  that have variety of uses laid out in the code   mayor adler would all residential uses allowed in sf6 or below be called residential   it extends to anything thats not   it has residential and lists below it the different varieties of residential  defining multifamily and condo et cetera   kitchen would it be acceptable to insert little i any residential use   mayor adler to insert little i   kitchen yeah   mayor adler any residential use   kitchen yeah permitted in    93743 pm  sf6 et cetera   mayor adler any residential use  adding the word residential in front of use   kitchen yes   mayor adler council member harpermadison are you okay with that   harpermadison im okay with that im looking at the specifications under residential bed and breakfast residential condominium  there are many uses im fine with that   mayor adler thats accepted   kitchen i have a different question about the same  what the intent is here im assuming  it says exempt the following from compatibility regulations im assuming were talking about the height aspect not the  not dumpsters lights noise other kinds of things with these smaller multifamily   93846 pm  youre not going to likely have any of those issues but if you get up to a  if you get up to 12 units you could have potentially like where the dumpsters are placed and stuff like that im assuming this was intended to  when it says compatibilityintended to speak to the height  is that the intent i think youre nodding yes   harpermadison i am   kitchen so if the staff understands it to mean that thats fine i dont know how you would word it to make that clear but can i hear from staff that they would read this to mean the height or    harpermadison for what its worth whenever we hear that something triggers compatibility were exclusively talking about height so theyre not taking into consideration some of the other regulatory   93947 pm  measures   if i may clarify compatibility  that triggers several different things height restrictions are one of them there are lighting dumpster location fencing i think its important that you clarify whether this is just applying to the height restrictions or whether its applying to the other restrictions as well that is something we would need to be codified    kitchen would it work to say exempt the following from compatibility regulations related to heights and setbacks would that cover everything   mayor adler are you okay adding height   i suggest we might want to put that at the top as long as it also includes the 25foot setback at number four because i think we would want to clarify that for everything it was not the intention to change the other items   94051 pm  mr rusthoven if we put it under number four and says modify the height compatibility regulations to  and then    mayor adler height and setback regulations   alter right   mayor adler modifies the height and setback compatibility regulations   alter and parking regulations in a separate section thank you for pointing that out   mayor adler number four says modifies to    kitchen am i hearing    alter side setbacks that we have to consider or is that just in the zone   mayor adler im sorry what   alter its the  i just want to make sure there are not other  we have been talking about the setback for when you can start building height and there are side and rear set   94152 pm  backs that we were not talking about modifying so i want to  it seems like the height one  the site setbacks are in the base zone so as long as we are understanding that if we say modifies the height and setback compatibility that we are talking about that kind of chart where its 25 feet and then hundred   mayor adler right   alter is that clear that way or   could you repeat it   alter if we says modifies the height and compatibility height and setback regulations that we would only be talking about because the rear and side and front ones would be determined by their base    94253 pm  zoning   yes   alter indiscernible compatibility   that would work to do modifies height and setback regulations   mayor adler without objection that amendment is incorporated   kitchen is that going in two places   calderon    mayor adler its in number four   alter do we need anything on number five for that   mayor adler i dont think so all right any other questions any other amendments to 66 council member tovo   kitchen wait i didnt    mayor adler go ahead so under 5a youre thinking that reference  i didnt hear what yall said  to end compatibility regulations would you not need height and setback there also   mayor adler that means you   94355 pm  only look  beyond a hundred feet does not set off compatibility does not trigger compatibility   i think we could add height because we dont want to not have the dumpster regulations i dont think that would be a problem   kitchen so 5a well put height also   mayor adler compatibility height and setback regulations on 5a okay all right we  out of the base document we can go to other amendments council member tovo   thanks mayor i distributed a motion sheet with two quick amendments the first prohibits type two   94458 pm   and type three shortterm rentals and units along the corridors theres been a lot of work from the working group and i appreciate it on thinking through compatibility and how we might adjust compatibility in reasonable ways and to make sure the housing stays housing and doesnt become hotels i think we should take action and prohibit type two and type three the second asks for additional tools to help understand how compatibility will look how the development post these will look on different sizes and depths so you know weve gotten some charts which are useful i think we need to see a couple  you know not  i dont think this adds time i dont think it adds expense   94558 pm  just some modelling and visual illustration of what some of the  using different lot deps and lot sizes which i think vary a lot depending on whether youre in the central city or south but taking different lot sizes and depths map out and provide with illustrations there those are my amendments i can offer them together or separately   mayor adler are we talking about the   im talking about all the units i think we have as has been said multiple times a housing crisis were trying  looking at ways to create more housing and to make sure that remains housing and not hotels i would urge that we prohibit shortterm rentals im not prohibiting type one which we know homeowners are using in part to help pay their property taxes and offset costs   94659 pm  to generate additional revenue but im suggesting we prohibit type two and three which are investment properties that are really hotels   mayor adler anybody want to speak to amendment number one mayor pro tem   alter i have a question to clarify broadly speaking i agree with the sentiment are you saying if they access the bonus for their entire property they cant do those or just for the bonus part or no matter where you are whether you use the bonus or not on these corridors   i would like to go with the less of those corridors to not have  shortterm rentals   alter so it would not  i dont think that would be found in section five because thats only about the bonus program so we need to figure out where that would go and discuss whether we want  whether the dais wants to do that it could be a number 8 but    94805 pm   it could be number 8 but wouldnt go under number 5   thank you   brief question   mayor adler council member vela   vela it would be less than 30 day rentals i dont want to impact a 90day lease these would be strictly city code regulations  only apply  okay thats fine   alter it would still allow somebody who owns a property to do a type one version    if you lived on the corridor you could shortterm your property under the code amendments for type one   mayor adler any objection to item number one were going to create it in number 8   94906 pm  type  short term rentals and units along the corridors i havent had a chance to vet that concept or anything but im okay passing this ordinance and moving it along and seeing how the conversation goes as this ordinance is developed okay that comes in as new section 8 section 2 asking staff to provide modelling or visual analysis of the lot sizes anybody have objection to that yes mayor pro tem   alter i dont object we have to figure out where it goes it seems to be it would be an additional be it further rel so ved   mayor adler i think youre right   alter right before the last one   mayor adler okay so this will be the penultimate   95007 pm  be it resolved second to last any objection hearing none thats included any other amendments to be offered to 66 before we vote council member vela   vela i have one that i passed out my understanding is that theres no waiver of compatibility regardless of the circumstances or situation and i think all laws should have some kind of waiver or exception when circumstances so warrant so im offering an amendment to allow the planning commission to waive compatibility and that can be appealed to city council    mayor adler mayor pro tem   alter do you think staff can explain how the board of variances works because i think we have  board of adjustment sorry   95111 pm   generally speaking generally speaking board of adjustment grants variances to  they do that when they make a finding theres a hardship in a particular case   kitchen i have a question    mayor adler would this be available if someone wanted a variance  would this be available for a board of adjustment variance   yes   kitchen i have a question   mayor adler council member kitchen   kitchen okay if im hearing correctly this would be the board  this citation is reference to the board of adjustment is that correct is that correct   in the motion sheet it says land use commission   kitchen so this would be in front of the planning commission right   yes current code in 25281 has a process where you can go under certain circumstances  you can go to the land use   95213 pm  commission under other circumstances you go to board of adjustment we could do something  apply that same to these particular  this set of regulations   kitchen okay whats the public input process part of this or is there a public input process as part of this request   because it would be a public hearing item in front of the land use commission it will follow the notice requirements that they follow   kitchen okay   if its in front of the boa they will follow the notice procedures    kitchen what would determine which one they go under is it the type of request or something thats all right if you dont have it right there i assume its something  maybe jerry knows   council member i believe youre referring to the code in   95319 pm  speaking rapidly   kitchen yes   they have public hearings like were having here today but there is a major difference with regard to board of adjust because its considered a quasi judicial board youre not allowed to lobby  not the public not the applicant planning commission is similar to city council it allows for lobbying contact between the commission members and the public   kitchen im wondering if council member vela would be amenable to adding to the end something to the effect which may be appealed to city council and which provides for an appropriate public input process   vela i would have no objection to adding that if i  the other reason that im bringing this is that my   95421 pm  understanding is that hardship as defined is an extremely high standard where it would otherwise  like the property would be kind of undevelopable if not for the waiver and thp would not be  were not talking about a situation where the property is undevelopable were talking about a situation where one triggering property is cutting down a number of units and for example that homeowner might even say you know what i dont care you know what i mean thats fine but theres no process via the city to actually do that you know and again i just want the  our planning commission and city council to consider it and if in the proper circumstances to waive it   kitchen im fine with that as long as were including some kind of public input process   mayor adler council member kitchen    alter im not okay we had a process that allows us   95523 pm   to waive compatibility at land use commission i think this is going to create a lot of havoc for our planning commission through all sorts of things and then were going to get all sorts of cases where its these little different things and we dont have the ability to waive that ability at our level i just think that really complicates things i think we can think about this and see if we come to a solution by the time the ordinance comes back im not comfortable when we have an existing process and the ramifications are huge for the process down the line in terms of vagaries of how things get handled and how its assigned to other commissions that can be lobbied   mayor adler council member kitchen   kitchen this is a resolution so it still has to come back to us right i mean thats the intent   95623 pm  so wed review it  wed have to review the amendments and then vote on them again so i dont have an issue around proceeding with this i think it makes sense to go ahead and proceed with it   alter dont think we want to empower our land use commission to make willynilly compatibility decisions based on no criteria   kitchen it doesnt say that   alter i know but the  we have a process for a lot of situations and so if you start to assess well they say they can do this much more if you get rid of compatibility then you dont have a compatibility rule  you go to your land use commission and waive what youre doing   kitchen what is the process that we already have   alter staff   thats a very good question   95728 pm   im looking at a version i can actually see   okay   so the waivers  the compatibility provisions of the code include a waiver section and 1080  its 25281 referenced in council member velas motion it authorizes the land use commission and on appeal to council to waiver requirement of the article if the land use commission or council determine that a waiver is appropriate and will not harm the surrounding area there are some parameters about the land use or council can do in terms of a setback it addresses when the land use or council can address a height restriction and then  sorry  it has another limitation about the authority related to  height but on top of all it it doesnt prevent someone from going to the board of adjustment to make a variance   95830 pm  request so there is a process in place what we would do if this passes is we would ensure that this particular set of regulations would be able to utilize the same process at 25281   mayor adler so  right now the waiver provision says you could have  you can waive things but then it puts in parameters for when you can waive or not waive  what kind of things can be considered or not i think by putting in those kind of direction people know kind of the field within which they would be potentially  things would be waived you want to go im concerned if we begin this   95930 pm  summer with a waiver position that doesnt have any parameters on it that were going to spend the next two or three months hearing from people that we pass something that would enable the planning commission to totally disregard compatibility standards and just waive it in all cases not that that would ever happen but that would be allowed by a strict reading of a waiver provision that doesnt have any parameters or limitations and im concerned about what happens in the public debate over the next two months if we have that i think what i would rather have councilmember vela is to develop the main part of the process so that it could come back from the planning commission with a waiver provision that had parameters in it that had gone through that process rather than  i just see myself with thousands of   100033 pm  emails from the constituent groups the constituent groups that im sending off emails  saying well that would never happen and the answer is that it could because thats what the words say so im inclined to not support this now but urge you and others to develop that as part of the ordinance strategy process and bring it back   vela i fully understand that mayor and i  my goal would not be to complicate the working groups draft and im going to go ahead and i will withdraw the amendment and i will look to maybe have the planning commission initiate something or take another look at the waiver process for compatibility and lets go ahead and let this process kind of finish and maybe we can pick up another process down the road   mayor adler thank you i appreciate that mayor pro tem    alter i think when we do that we should really be adhering to our existing process and making sure that this works through the existing process but   100135 pm  because were already essentially waiving stuff like im not sure what you have to waive in this case for  for the hardships that would be different than what is in our twisting process and thats what we  existing process and thats what we have to understand and having a detailed look of that process i think that it is fine   mayor adler so lets develop and come back i think that it might be around there councilmember kelly thank you   kelly i just want to make note that its 1000 and we should probably vote to continue thank you   mayor adler a motion to extend past 1000 a second councilmember ellis seconds it any objection seeing none    i have to abstain maine mayor pro tem is abstaining and no objections we will proceed past 1000 but lets see if we can move quicker any changes to 66 before we vote we have lost kathie where did   100235 pm  kathie go   vela i think she just went to the back for a moment so i have one question on the city piece that i know  where did my copy go in the  in the version 2 that is offered it says that it would just  it would not be the use it would only be the zoning category that would trigger compatibility however my understanding is that there are for example civic uses i believe that camp nabri is s3 and i think that there are churches and other organizations or other  you know that are sf3 and theres not an sf3 use on the property but it is still triggering compatibility as a zone that is sf3 so what about combining and saying that it has to be both  an sf zone property plus a   100336 pm  singlefamily use you know not a church for example on a singlefamily zone property or not some other type of civic use on an sf3 property that is triggering compatibility i know that has been an issue with a handful of  of properties and it can be you know it could be a real  it could be problematic    mayor adler requiring both use if there is any and the zone  if theres no use then its just the zone if theres a use than it has to be use and a zone   vela that it would be both sf3 zoning and sf3 use not sf3 zoning used by a non   mayor adler that makes sense to me let me check with my other colleagues   kitchen so im sorry what is the    100439 pm   mayor adler councilmember kitchen   i believe that councilmember    i thought that it would be helpful for you to give us a little bit of information   so the example that councilmember vela raises has occurred several times and its not what compatibility was intended for and its true that churches are allowed in every zoning category including singlefamily so we had situations where churches did trigger compatibility we always looked at it as intended for residential uses as opposed to religious services use so that amendment to me would make sense to regard to churches   mayor adler it would make sense   yes   mayor adler mayor pro tem   alter so i would like to say that maybe we could do it as what we have in terms of either zoning and then explore the combination and its likely fine and i can do you know 100 i know that   100539 pm  we have schools that are triggering in some areas where this matters but without  you know i dont know that it doesnt create a problem you know  when we put together this proposal we really went through and scoured lots of examples of things so i think that its something that is absolutely something that we should explore through this process so i dont know if we can  if we can say you know do it for sure with the  you know its not triggered by use but by zoning and then explore how you would do that combination i think that it should be  it should be fine because you know camp nabri should be triggering it not that theres much anything around it that would be an issue but we have schools for instance that are sf1 that are   that are triggering things that would be a good candidate for it i would just be a lot more comfortable if we could say to    100641 pm  do it our way and put that in the exploring section and if it turns out that it really makes a lot of sense which it may then we  then we just add it in the ordinance part so giving an option to do it and i would be  you know  you know it could be brought to council even before we finalize them and share and we could make a decision   chair if i have the information what civic uses are allowed in singlefamily categories so you can exactly what those are and we can report that back to council if you like   alter but its also  you know part what we did as we put this together is to really look around the city and to see sort of the impact and what made sense absent of full planning process and so i would just  i would like to have that opportunity to think about that before determining absolutely yes because one of the things that we learned as we went through different things is that some   100742 pm  things you didnt really expect had big impacts and so i do think that its something that i can get behind 100 but at this stage i would   i would propose that we put it in the section where we had the exploring section the third to last one where we have sort of applying light rail or larger corridor regulations to tods and providing analysis that the affordable housing capacity yield to us   mayor adler what about number five that says explore limiting triggers as concerned civic uses and also nonresidential uses in residential zones   vela that sounds excellent to me mayor and just as a note i believe that the camp nabri sf3 floor clipped a floor off one of the bull creek buildings along there that i think is where  at least my staff and i got the   100845 pm  initial idea that  that you know i had no idea    mayor adler that makes sense so put in the explore category and number five would say to explore limiting triggers as concerned civic uses and also nonresidential uses in residential zones any objection to that   kitchen can you say that one more time    mayor adler explore limiting triggers as concerns civic uses and also nonresidential uses in residential zones okay that is included any other amendments before we go on and vote on 66 those in favor of 66 please raise your hand those opposed is councilmember harpermadison with us councilmember harpermadison is with us so i see unanimous on the dais 66 passes   actually mayor my amendment   100946 pm  is raised it was one of the amendments that we didnt cover   mayor adler okay   harpermadison and it was the first one   mayor adler this was including options for compatibility setback distances   harpermadison correct   we included the provide analysis of the affordable housing capacity yield of this resolution in the third to last be it resolved as opposed to the other options   kitchen i dont think that was for an amendment though councilmember harpermadison are you talking about the one that you posted on the message   101048 pm  board   mayor adler yes it says include options for setback distances of 25 50  indiscernible sooner and my only concern with this was that were trying to send a message to the community that were trying to find that place where the vin diagrams overlap and well be gone for the next two months and im just real concerned about a community that gets wrapped around the axle for the next two months thinking that were going to do something with compatibility at 25 feet or 50 feet i dont think that is  well while i may do that if it was just me  um thats not kind of what this exercise is and im just afraid that would involve us in a community debate or discussion that wasnt on point and we would lose momentum but i do think that asking the question about what is the yield   101149 pm   with these other options is a fair question to ask and thats the kind of thing that each of us have the ability to ask staff and we in fact are asking staff to come back with that data so we would have that data and that information and certainly if the consensus point changes someone could move to amend this later on but in this statement were saying at this point where we think that the vin diagrams intersect so my request would be that we dont try to trigger something that  that is different than trying to reach the compromise we put in here getting the analysis and we are all asking for the analysis of these different distances so well have the information and in case theres a consensus or movement to amend this as part of the ordinance approval process   101254 pm   vela mayor   mayor adler yes councilmember vela   vela can i make a suggestion on the resolution and maybe other possible compatibility options you know or something to that effect you know  this goes from the vmu analysis that the staff gave us which i thought that was very helpful you know where they were talking about the compatibility limitations on the vmu and the map that they put together and then like saying that if you do it at this level we capture 30 of the properties and at this level 50 of the properties flvment my and from my perspective that was very helpful   mayor adler i know that we dont want to call them options but what if we said provide analysis and affordable housing capacity in this resolution and other compatibility distances   vela i think  i think that language is fine if   101357 pm  councilmember harpermadison is okay with it   harpermadison i guess that i just want to make certain that my intention is understood mayor i heard what you said and it kind of sounds to me like youre concerned that  that my attempt is to sort of stymie the process but i really am  i am just asking for information and so  but hopefully thats how you understand it   mayor adler well i was  i was seeing the word options and other things and that made me think that maybe it was alternatives and i didnt want to go to options or alternatives because this resolution is about this and the standards that we have here represent where we think that the compromise is and where the vin diagrams cross and that    101458 pm  we get the higher number of votes so i want to make it clear that were not passing this to consider other alternatives but to the degree that you just ask for data which people can do directly to staff otherwise i was seeing whether there could be agreement on just saying in other compatibility distances whether that is sufficiently separated us is there language that could    harpermadison sure in theory but i just want to make sure that im being really clear that were on the same page as we move forward i  you know i have already said before that  i say it all the time  that these landuse conversations they really involve a lot of complex concepts that can really fly over the head of our constituents and lay people and i think that as we wade through these super thick weeds you need to be a subject matter expert to really hack through it all so i think that given as councilmembers we have so much on our plate consistently so many considerations you know the budget public safety   101559 pm  public health um i think you know  were trying to guide the  you know the construction of a worldclass transit system i think that it is stretched pretty thin and in my minds eye it would be best to leave it to the trained experts on our staff to do their jobs and to bring us comprehensive options and so i was really asking as a policymaking body that we have the ability to make those datadriven decisions i certainly wasnt making any attempt to have people be fearful that we are initiating anything that  you know that we hadnt discussed with them i do want you know you are my colleagues and the general public to understand that i just really would like to know based on expert produced data what some of the options could be   mayor adler so lets do this because i  i have rodney   101701 pm  sitting next to me here and i asked rodney you are now making the request for that data and that information for other distances and i am asking rodney if you will provide that to councilmember harpermadison   we certainly will yeah if we take requests we will provide that data   mayor adler okay i think that you should consider it as a request because we have all heard it and probably shes not alone in making that request so my question for you councilmember harpermadison given that and the commitment just made by rodney here in open session you will get the information and data as you just said are you okay then not putting it into the resolution itself    harpermadison oh it feels like the conversation is just the two of us right now and i wouldnt mind to hear from some of our colleagues to gauge from them how theyre feeling about moving forward with it as part of the resolution or just information that we receive from   101801 pm  acm gonzales and staff   mayor adler sounds good mayor pro tem   alter if you have a question from staff they would present it to you and i would prefer to have it done that way   mayor adler councilmember kitchen   kitchen i would suggest that it would be better if it would be presented to the entire council and there would be a recognition by the council that it could be data that we might want to use when this comes back to us   mayor adler okay could you please provide that information to everyone   absolutely and just to be clear that was our intention was to provide the response    kitchen i figured it was and i just wanted to specify but i think that councilmember harpermadison is also asking to have information that she or others may want to point to when this comes back to us   mayor adler there would be nothing stopping anyone from doing that   kitchen okay just wanted to put that on the record   mayor adler yes okay   harpermadison thank you councilmember kitchen i appreciate that   mayor adler thank you   101902 pm  councilmember harpermadison any other amendments to 66 councilmember kitchen   kitchen we had a conversation that  we had a conversation at a work session that i dont see reflected in here and so i just want to raise it again it may be similar to what we just did it may be a direction kind of thing as opposed to any language we had a conversation about the importance of our city policy to provide opportunities for affordable housing throughout the city and we also had a conversation about the  you know about insuring that when we were looking at making these kinds of changes which are linked to corridors and affordability that we really be looking throughout the city i  am concerned that we really havent accomplished that im concerned that this is focused in certain parts of the city and not in others   102003 pm  i think thats just a function of the way that we have defined things in the past so i would like to ask  i would like to ask if theres room for  for staff to  to consider  you know something along the lines of considering or exploring additional transit corridors as needed to promote the citys policy to locate affordable housing throughout the city im just asking if theres any  we  i dont think that we have addressed that and im wanting to  im requesting or asking if theres room to have that conversation when this comes back to us and i would throw that out for my colleagues to see if theres interest in either a direction or adding language to that effect   102108 pm   vela councilmember kitchen if i could and staff can help with this conversation you may remember that we have the strategic housing blueprint and that strategic housing blueprint has goals by district for affordable housing so thats our overarching program that we implement as staff and so in everything that we do we are always going to attempt to achieve those goals by district   kitchen okay so im hearing that to say in everything that we do so here we are looking at making changes to compatibility on specified corridors so as staff works on this when you come back to us i would like part of that conversation of what comes back to us to tell us you know if you recommend or suggest or just identify that this tool that were putting in place is really not addressing parts of the city if thats the case i would like to have that conversation then   absolutely i can  i can ask staff to   102209 pm  confirm you know when we bring this back you know as we look at the corridors that well also look at it by district to give you that information   kitchen okay if  im fine with that as long as  im just wanting to let my  well you know im the only one talking here and ask others if its just me but ask what others think but i am concerned i dont see this as  as really  you know if someone  well anyway if the information comes back and says well weve already got a lot of affordable housing in certain districts and we dont need to worry about this tool thats great but if it comes back and says were using this tool and were not using this tool in  parts of the city where were really not getting much affordable housing for our goals then we really ought to have a conversation about whether we ought to use these tools thats all im trying to say   okay sounds good   102310 pm   so i just want to address that because one of the things that we do and we see on our agenda is that we have many tools to address housing and they dont all fit every part of town so we have passed adu resolution i think that we passed the planning resolution compatibility is not what is  compatibility and parking is not what is constraining growth in my district since i think that this is directed at me we looked at several places that are not included in this and changes and compatibility and changes in parking and they dont have any transit and theyre not constrained by compatibility and their underlining zoning doesnt go above a certain mount so really the planning district process and the adu process and those are better tools the process that were undergoing with ut and those are better   102410 pm  tools for addressing the growth in other parts of town this tool itself on its own is not going to get there and it wont  i mean one could add it to make one feel that were doing more in other parts but its actually going to have zero impact and its just because of whats there on the ground and if we want to move forward we have to be using those other tools   kitchen i was not trying to focus on district 10 that was not my intent but my intent was just to ask the question about whether this is a tool  its really to ask the question that you just raised you know is this a tool that really we should use in other parts of the city thats the question that im asking maybe it isnt and maybe it is i just want us to be open to having that conversation thats all you know we do have transit   102513 pm  identified corridors in other parts of the city that we didnt include in here we didnt include our transit priority network for good reasons but there are other  there are other roads that are part of the tpm that might be appropriate to include all im saying is lets just  i just want to  i just dont want to have this come back to us in september and have it said because we didnt put anything in this resolution that we cant have the conversation then thats all im trying to say   mayor adler and i  i am comfortable at this point to let that develop as part of the ordinance development process i think that its a good point to make and as the ordinance goes through the  process it can be further developed by other stakeholders involved in this process and other processes i would suggest that we pass this and move on   kitchen i think that you have one person over there   mayor adler yes councilmember   vela i just wanted to agree and i was making very similar arguments on  on it too and i think that it would be   102613 pm  helpful and very reasonable to have staff to maybe look at what other corridors that we could roll into as part of this process you know particularly i mean weve got a lot of transit for example in my district my entire district is core you know medium and large corridors but other districts dont  we do want to put housing there too so i just want to say that i would be very supportive of what councilmember kitchen is proposing   mayor adler what we tried to do  and i find as we go through the process that people can come up and even identify certain roads that they think that ought to be included you know we were trying to come up with categories and come up with something that we could apply but certainly in this process they could come back to us from planning commission with a specific road on it and it wasnt included and then theres nothing to stop that from happening as part of the process all right lets go ahead and take a vote on 66 ready those in favor of 66   102715 pm  please raise your hand those opposed unanimous on the dais is that right okay   indiscernible   mayor adler we did but again its unanimous but then  and thats right but then  councilmember harpermadison recognized or pointed out that she had her hand raised and i didnt call on her so we doubled back all right lets go to the next item now all right i think that gets us up to 124 councilmember harpermadison   kitchen mayor you want to take 80 first   mayor adler lets do 124 first   102815 pm   councilmember   harpermadison im certain that this is one that we have gotten a lot of emails about and so im pretty happy to be bringing the item forward you know its one of our oldest and most iconic parts of the city and so its really important as some of our colleagues have already recognized that we do as much as we can to make it as vibrant and robust as possible so im moving that we bring forward item number 24   mayor adler councilmember tovo pulled this and is there a second to that councilmember kelly seconds that and councilmember tovo you pulled this   tovo i did thank you councilmember harpermadison talked about the historic nature of it and i passed out a sheet and that this is a historic district one of the very few that we have here in austin i can talk about these   102915 pm  amendments or not but i will just leave it out there for now but this will ensure that we get  we actually get a historic review which i think that is appropriate necessary critical its my understanding the applicant or the attorney for the applicant has reviewed the amendments and is comfortable with them this is you know to kind of set the stage i mean this is a code amendment that has been requested by an applicant who owns blocks of sixth street and has initiated  or requested the initiation of these code amendments to construct a redevelopment   mayor adler okay is the applicant agent here are you okay with these amendments   council my name is richard saidler and here proposing these and yes were okay with the amendments   mayor adler okay any further or objections to   103017 pm  these amendments being included   vela can we change one ordinance im sorry just change the word applicant to developer on where it says after line 16    mayor adler yes   vela we really dont have an applicant i think that developer would be a better word   mayor adler okay   tovo thank you    mayor adler it should already a say developer rather than the developer   tovo well it is a very particular  i mean this is a code amendment responding to a very specific request from a specific developer so i think we should be transparent   mayor adler does it say that in the body of this its asking for a wider study i may remember wrong the base document   harpermadison it does not and for what its worth mayor i dont think that is necessary i think we find inspiration from a multitude of sources and we dont always make reference to that as part of the process of   103117 pm  adopting the item so i think that for what its worth we can  we can accomplish what were attempting to accomplish especially with councilmember tovos amendments accepted by the applicant   mayor adler okay   harpermadison i have a few remarks that i would like to make but i think that we can move forward   mayor adler we will change applicant to developer any objections to this amendment being included councilmember kelly   tovo theres another reference to applicant and if they could change them both so its not the city   kelly i just have a question in our discussions related to initiating code amendments such as this if it really makes any difference where it comes from im not sure that ive ever experienced this type of initiation and so i just want the public to also understand if it matters how we got to this point if were trying to accomplish a goal regardless of where it comes from if that makes sense   mayor adler i think that for me i think that for the overall   103218 pm  safety and culture and viability of the city i think that theres been a lot of us who for years have been talking about encouraging more family uses on that street so i think that this happens without any developer moving forward but im happy that there is someone indicating interest   kelly and i appreciate that because to me it doesnt matter what vehicle the initiation comes to council with if collectively we agree that its a good thing to move forward with we absolutely should do that   mayor adler good point mayor pro tem    alter i just want to speak on the process because im really uncomfortable about an amendment  an initiative of this magnitude being initiated by council without the councilmember whose district it is in being part of the quorum that is not a precedent that i am real comfortable with and i dont know how that happened or whatever but i think that is really   103320 pm  unfortunate people are elected to represent their district and they have special knowledge and something of this magnitude that really should be part of what we see   mayor adler okay we have item 124 as amended   tovo i want to thank my colleague and say that it certainly introduces a new precedent   mayor adler we have 124 moved and seconded and amended any further discussion before we vote councilmember harpermadison   harpermadison thank you mayor i appreciate that i do have a few more words that id like to share but briefly i will respond to mayor pro tems concerns and just say that you know that there was a lot of consideration that went into the process and im happy to share with you offline if you would like to know exactly how we came to the decision to  to move forward like we did including you   103420 pm  know which im happy to share publicly including you know we dont know what this dais will look like next year and so in my minds eye the best path forward is the easiest way to get good results when the time is right and so all of those things happened to culminate now and as i said i recognize especially you know being an austinite and having sixth street means so much to my formative experience and having you know sixth street be truly a part of you know me growing up in this city and i do appreciate that the district is not mine by way of my professional capacity but it very much feels like a part of me as a person who is from this city and so while i can appreciate that theres no precedent necessarily i will request some   103520 pm  grace and acknowledgement that as an austinite i mean its the city center and it means a lot of things to me personally which was a large part of why i decided to bring the item forward and a large part you know of me recognizing that people from all over the world you know come to this town i have been all over the world and told people to go to sixth street you know its ground zero for south by  southwest you know its had multiple identities over the past two centuries you know some of those things are  are not proud moments for the city of austin some of those things are really proud moments for people of african descent and africanamericans and you know and the middle of central texas there are a lot of special  there is rather a lot of special symbolism in this historic district as councilmember tovo pointed out but ill say you know that in the last several decades you know i was probably on the front end of that in my high   103622 pm  school days you know its evolved into a raucous entertainment district you know that is live with shop owners and we all know what that means were aware of the problems that creates i think that many folks have been talking for years about trying to transform what is sixth street into a more mixeduse and more familyfriendly environment i remember distinctly thought that it was not okay to bring my children downtown after dark and i would like us to fix that and i think with all kinds of businesses that activate the street you know day and night were more inclined to get closer to meeting that goal so i appreciate councilmember tovos leadership in multiple ways but the efforts to address safety in this area we are definitely taking into consideration and it has clearly become more of an issue over the years so i think my resolution here works handinhand with that with that previous effort those   103724 pm  previous intentions and commitment to the district by unlocking land use constraints that i think that prevent more diversity uses here   mayor adler okay any other statements on this item member   growing up here in austin and were a segregated city and the africanamerican have one block  one side of the block in that area and the mexicanamericans have one side of the block right across from the theater and you know this  and christian and muslims have their section right there on red river and we had our bars right there by sixth street by waller creek and you know it was an area where all races could come   103824 pm  together it just was an amazing setup the way that it was set up in a segregated city like it was back then and we were all got together you know we have the black businesses there but on the east side of the red river it was an industrial business car repair all kinds of you know small businesses that just didnt fit in that area and thats what were facing right now were facing an area there that has been exempted over years after years after years and they have become known to be little bars that sells  liquor all night long and people hang out there late at night were having shootings stabbings down there and its time that we clean up that whole area   103926 pm  and this is why im supporting this the ones that have historic significance the buildings there that we make sure that theyre preserved and they could go behind it or on top of it but it wasnt the good side of downtown it was more like a little red light district down there so im really going to support  thats why im supporting this because i think that with waller creek and the investment that were making now there on waller creek this is a high opportunity area where we can make it the place where people want to come and to visit   mayor adler for what its worth i really appreciate the historical anecdotes and perspective that you give us and when a day comes that youre not on this council anymore that information is just going to be sorely missed   104026 pm  thank you mayor pro tem   alter thank you i just want to explain my vote on this im going to abstain i believe that this is probably the right process to move forward with but i am uncomfortable with the process and i do believe that we need to respect expertise of districts that doesnt mean that someone has to be the lead but i think that voice and that information should be part of it i do believe that we need to take steps forward on sixth street but i just wanted to explain my vote due to the process on that thats where im going to come out   mayor adler lets take a vote those  councilmember tovo   tovo i have comments we have spent a lot of time on this dais over the last year talking about sixth street and my colleagues are right i think that councilmember harpermadison you said that it has been a goal  actually it was the mayor  to change the uses and theres all kinds of ways to do that this is a code amendment that is   104127 pm  being initiated to respond to a developers proposal who owns 28 properties certainly one option would be to lease out some of those properties to different kinds of uses you have the opportunity to do that as a property owner i am intrigued certainly by the proposal and i have met with the developer  multiple times and i appreciate  i appreciate that outreach and im interested in seeing more details around the commitments that theyve said that theyll make to street scape improvements and some of the other things that have been discussed for a while and some of the amendments that speak to that and direct that kind of work and i look forward to seeing the results of that but for me i really  because its being paired with some pretty extensive demolitions in our national register historic district im going to rely on our preservation community and preservation austin and our landmark commission to better understand what the impact is going to be on the historic character and the historic fabric in what is a prime national register of historic district so im not prepared to   104229 pm  support this today and i will abstain and consider it carefully as it goes through the process   mayor adler okay i support this resolution i think that basically with the added language in this it really equates to a small area plan which we need to be doing this particular small area plan i think deserves this priority in part because of the safety issues that were dealing with and this has been a longtime goal to deal with this and the opportunity that was uniquely presented itself because of what is happening in the marketplace and without that we dont have the same opportunity so having been presented with this opportunity and having pulled back so that its not prescriptive but really allowing for a small area plan and i absolutely agree that now is the time to bring in the expertise that we have on staff from all different departments to help with this so im going to vote for it councilmember tovo   104329 pm   tovo thank you i forgot that i had a question for the sponsor about this last resolved where it talks about the small area plan theres the first line that talks about as part of the ordinance process that the city staff stakeholders relevant commissions and the public may consider potential and regulated and  and related regulation or ordinance changes in addition to or instead of those above im not sure what that means in the context of initiating code amendments does that mean that members of the public can suggest other code amendments along the way and theyll get folded into the planning commission process what does that mean   mayor adler i dont want to speak for the sponsor    harpermadison i dont think that i understand your question   tovo sure the language beginning on page 33  on line 33 as part of the ordinance process initiated above the city staff stakeholders relevant commissions and the public may consider potential and related regulation or ordinance changes    104430 pm  in addition to or instead of those described above im trying to understand what the role of the public is there is the role  are you  are you describing the public process that is the same as what we would ordinarily follow in a code amendment that they can go and provide feedback at the boards or are you actually suggesting  suggesting that the public can consider potential unregulated regulation and ordinance changes in addition to what you have described here this is what the language says  that in addition to what is described here that the public  it sounds like the public can suggest other kinds of code amendments and ask that those also be included in the process   harpermadison im not suggesting that we do anything outside of the parameters of what we would normally do in terms of public input and contribution to the process   tovo so your language there is intended to just refer to the public providing feedback to the amendments that have been   104531 pm  initiated    harpermadison would you word that differently in order to make that    tovo i probably would have talked about it in terms of public feedback rather than the public considering other  you know other potential related regulation and ordinance changes   mayor adler i understand that to give them the ability to go beyond the prescriptions contained in this more in the nature of a small area plan so it can go beyond and be different than what is prescribed here but its trying to figure out what is the best way from a planning perspective to look at this stretch of roadway so this  the things that are listed in here it could come back that way but maybe not as it goes through the process so i see this as being more openended than a specific direction to authorize and initiate an ordinance to  to replan this area in a particular   104635 pm  way   harpermadison i guess the  so as im reading this and im seeing what  how the words matter the city staff component the relevant commissions component  so when we go on to say land use in the district this could include recommendations for an alternate or additional small area plan so i think that its important to sort of point out that theres different symbolism for different members of this group that are included so the city staff stakeholders and relevant commissions and the public so you  know the city staff and the public obviously have different roles they operate in different capacities so i would say that the part about  consider potential and related regulation or ordinance changes in addition to or instead of those described above i would say that the city staff   104736 pm  relevant commissions are making recommendations and my hope is that is  to some degree inspired by influenced by the contributions from the general public and stakeholders who arent a part of the decisionmaking process   tovo okay thank you   mayor adler okay lets go ahead and take a vote on item number    tovo can i ask about  how would a plan get initiated as described and this might be a question for mr rustovan is that something that the council or the planning commission would need to initiate as a separate action   harpermadison are you asking  im sorry    mayor adler jerry is coming to the dais   tovo i was asking jerry whether this action is enough to initiate a small area plan or   104837 pm  whether that is something that would need to be initiated as a separate action either by council or the planning commission   i can tell you council small impact plans have in the past been initiated by council so to be incorporated into an item from council it could be done that way   tovo but would you  would you  were not exactly initiating  thats not what this last passage is doing its kind of saying if along the way others suggest that thats a good approach it could then become the approach if im understanding this correctly but that would still then need another action from the council   we would generally like to have specific direction to engage in the planning endeavor with council with the commission   tovo so it sounds like that would then need to be an action that takes place at council okay thank you   mayor adler okay lets take a vote those     tovo i dont know who added this but i dont know if this was councilmember harper maidson   104938 pm  or one of the cosponsors but if theres a intent to have a small area plan i think that is going to have to be    mayor adler i think that  my reading of this is they could come back and recommend that or if the process enabled them to come up with the plan and the direction they could come back with that but theyre not limited to just the prescriptive things that were described here i think that is what it says those in favor please raise your hand   harpermadison its 124   mayor adler 124 raise your hand those opposed it is unanimous on the dais  im sorry two abstentions is that what it was prayer pro tem and councilmember tovo abstaining and others voting aye it passes thank you all right we i think that we have two things that are left lets do the vmu item number 80   105039 pm  councilmember theres a draft ordinance that came back from staff with the resolution that we passed last fall councilmember kitchen has proposed amendments to that and requested that be used as the base motion that we consider and i will treat it that way but well go through councilmember kitchens amendments to see and to take a vote whether or not to include them councilmember kitchen   kitchen yes mayor id like to make the motion and then explain a bit about whats in here so that people will understand it   mayor adler thats fine   kitchen i move passage of the substitute motion which is marked at the top as housing and planning committee recommendation vmu   mayor adler okay not quite a substitute motion because its the first one out   105139 pm   kitchen okay   mayor adler that is okay it is just the motion and then seconded by councilmember pool    kitchen okay   mayor adler you can speak to it first   kitchen by way of explanation this is the version that i passed out to everyone it is in backup noted as the version that was voted out of the housing and planning committee as a recommendation and it says corrected out of after it because we had to  yeah so you all have that in front of you there are  the differences between this version and what the staff brought back are yellowed so you can tell that and there are also differences that are in a dark blue and those are the amendments from councilmember vela that we  that i accepted in the housing and planning committee and the housing and planning committee voted out so that should give you an   105240 pm  explanation of what the differences are so i know that also that a number of people have other amendments and i have one other amendment too so mayor would you like to go through this document first and then take up other amendments   mayor adler yes   kitchen okay so would you like me to talk through each section or how would you like to do this   mayor adler we could or you have talked to it generally and speak to it generally and see if people want to speak to it generally and well go to the pages and hit the highlighted yellow and the highlighted blue things   kitchen okay   mayor adler okay so for me  im probably  im going to vote for the staffs proposed resolution i mean the proposed ordinance because i think it reflects what it was that we said we wanted to do and most importantly i think it keeping vmu happening as a matter of right which i think that is  is  is a threshold   105344 pm  for me i think that if we do anything other than vmu by rights were not meeting the moment that we have the real challenge the existential challenge that we have to do housing i think that it would be a huge and significant difference so im going to vote against the changes that have anything other than this being just a change within the vmu  zone category   kitchen so mayor there are more changes that do not  do not have anything to do with whether its by right or not the concern that youre raising about the by right process is in the very last section so where dont we talk about that first    mayor adler we can talk about it and i think that its  as i was going to go on  im comfortable with the compatibility that we just passed in 66 and i think that is what the compatibility provision should be because it applies to   105447 pm  this when 66 comes back as an ordinance because its the affordability provision and then i would recommend that we keep to the percentages that were originally proposed by staff and i say that almost because we just dont have the    kitchen so mayor what id like to do is that i would like to go sectionbysection   mayor adler thats what i was proposing   kitchen and i would like to vote on each section   mayor adler thats what i was proposing   kitchen i think that is a better way to do that so lets be specific so lets start with the one that is do people need a moment or  should i continue huh okay all right so lets start with the one at the end which is on page 9   105549 pm  its part 5 so what part 5 does is that it creates  it specifies what the public  what the public process is for vmu2 now remember that only applies to  to properties that are already zoned vmu so what it is saying is that to add vmu2 to property that is already zoned v that the process would be a zoning process essentially which carries with it notice individual notice to properties within a certain distance and also the right to protest so thats the difference that were talking about here   105651 pm  and what i want to say  i want to say how i got to this point i really  i really believe that  you know first let me say that vmu is a program that was created in collaboration with residents our residents throughout the central city identified properties along corridors that were  that they really wanted to designate for affordable housing so this was a  a community effort that was  that created vmu so i believe that  to me its fundamental fairness and respect for the public i believe that fundamental fairness and respect for the public requires that people be notified when land use around their homes is being changed    105849 pm  so that they can exercise their right to be if there is concern to suggest were going to say these with go to 90 feet  people who live near these properties we could consider a cup process which weve done  if we strike section five  if the council chooses to strike section 5 what youre saying in effect the that these changes go into effect people have no right to be notified about their change near their house and they dont have a right to say anything about it to me thats fundamentally unfair i would like to vote it  mayor if you want to make a motion to delete this thats fine lets have a conversation and lets vote on it   mayor adler okay i would move we keep the way the staff originally proposed it   kitchen mayor thats  the motion  if you want to make a motion i would say   105949 pm  strike part five thats what it would do what you want to do   mayor adler i understand that my motion  god ann   kitchen well i mean   mayor adler my motion is to keep it by right i move to strike part five is there a second to that motion mayor pro tem seconds it any discussion lets take a vote those in favor of striking part five please raise your hand vela mayor pro tem ellis harpermadison me thats one two three four five six seven eight those against please raise your hand against my amendment it is kitchen tovo   110054 pm  thats right kitchen tovo pool and kelly 74 amendment passes   kitchen was it 7 i only counted 6 its 74 okay lets move on wait council member tovo did you want to say something   i didnt have an opportunity to speak before we took the vote but i wanted to underscore what you had to say and you know this is  i was glad to be a cosponsor on it it caused a lots of questions and we assured  i think its important to stick to what we have heard again and again from the public what they want us to do which is to notify them when there are proposals that are significantly different than the zoning on the ground they want the opportunity to participate in them as my colleague said and i think its of grave concern to me that were moving    110155 pm  forward potentially with that vote in a way that doesnt allow folks the opportunity to have petition rights   mayor adler lets move on   mayor right here apologies there are additional references in part one that we would need to strike to make your amendment  moving part five effective   mayor adler would you call those out so we can make sure   e dits in part one   mayor adler okay   highlighted properties designated as v2 432 we have reference to the section that was created in part five so we would need to strike that as well   mayor adler okay so i would imagine its going to be the same vote to strike   kitchen we dont need to vote on that i mean    mayor adler 436 comes out   110257 pm  432 what about sup part d   we need to keep d   mayor adler okay   kitchen okay ill move on    mayor adler hang on hang on staff likes part d that addition change   its not dependent on v2 designation we have it in the staff version as well as this version because the way that this section is set up in the code article 4 it uses reference vmu building   mayor adler why is it highlighted in yellow   apologies it was highlighted because i moved it from a different section   mayor adler is it okay in this section or should it be moved back   its fine here    mayor adler any objection  im not going to move to take the out   kitchen could i please go next in order   mayor adler do you have an amendment   kitchen i am taking these in order   110358 pm   mayor adler ann im running this i am running this youve made your motion now im making amendments   kitchen and mayor if you would let me i know whats in here in terms of substance and i think if we can take it in a certain order it will make more sense for folks what youre  i would like to go    mayor adler what about compatibility in part three   kitchen i thought wed come back to that thats not the major difference   mayor adler it is a difference we passed a compatibility section in 66 and i would move to take out the compatibility here so the compatibility of 66 applies   kitchen heres what ill say about this this was something that we included as part of our housing committee because this is an ordinance and it provided for more immediate changes and   110500 pm  its something that we talked about helping out with project connect but it is council member velas amendment so i will let him speak to it   mayor adler okay   vela yeah i would like to  this has a meeting effect where as item 66 does not have immediate effect given everything moving forward with project connect i would like to encourage the construction of housing along this line with the affordability bonus in vmu as soon as we can possibly get it i understand that the compatibility provisions in item 66 are potentially broader im excited about that but i would like to keep this  again this is limited to only two the orange and blue lines only to properties that touch that   110602 pm   line it to me dove tails very well with our broader transit and housing goals and its  it will ultimately i think help with regard to project connect and pulling in funding from the feds as well in preparing for this  we talked with lots of folks you know atp randy clark and public  in public interviews made the same statements that if we want the project to be a success we have to change our landuse patterns surrounding the investments were interested in   mayor adler any further discussion on this issue do we have council member yor pro tem with us   she went to get some ice   110704 pm  cream   kitchen are you making a motion to remove part three what is your motion   mayor adler i made a motion to remove part three and it was seconded the  anybody want to second the motion to strike part three or no without a second it will fail okay part three stays in lets go to the next section   kitchen next section is the parking section on page 3 which is also council member velas amendment so ill let him speak to that   vela again thats the companion version to what we have just discussed and i would like to keep it in same reason same logic same everything   mayor adler okay anybody else want to take up that parking section on 66 no well keep that in next  go ahead   110807 pm   kitchen next    mayor adler hang on counsel   apologies we have a typo on part four i would like permission to clarify were changing the three sections instead of the one   kitchen where did you say   part four amending section for e and within e so far in the draft we only have two of those numbers  two of the items listed and there should be a third which is 433e   mayor adler which line   47 and 48    mayor adler youre adding a third reference   correct which would attract the parking piece   mayor adler were going to leave that piece in because no one wants to take it out that gets us to percentages on 148 and 145   kitchen i want to speak to   110907 pm  those   mayor adler hang on a second   kitchen its my    mayor adler under rules  you have made a motion and someone can make an amendment when someone makes an amendment to a motion they  theres an attempt to find a second and if theres a second the person who makes the motion speaks to it thats the rules thats how weve always done it   mayor i would note that the council member hasnt been able to lay out her item with the changes   mayor adler i offered the chance to lay out the item and we were talking about it and then the chickens came out and interrupted the process i have told her she could lay it out   kitchen im going to lay it out right now im going to lay out the change that is on page five because thats where were at this is a change that has to do with the affordability or for   111017 pm  vmu2 what ive proposed is a minimum of 15 per cent and this applies to rental minimum of 15 per cent if someone is at 60 per cent mfi or minimum of 12 per cent when someone is at 50 per cent ive had a lot of conversation with staff about this they did come back with lower levels theyll have to tell me  i cant remember exactly what it was at that time when they came back we hadnt made any changes to compatibility so the thinking is that some level higher than is appropriate because were providing additional height but also making significant changes to compatibility particularly along the orange and blue line it seems to make sense to do the 15 per cent and the 12 per   111120 pm   cent thats what i would suggest my understanding from staff is that theyre okay with that theyre okay with it because we have additional compatibility and  so that that allows  i dont want to put words in their mouth but my last conversation with them was that this appears to be workable and so i would like to proceed with it at 15 per cent and 12 per cent   mayor   mayor adler yes council member ellis   ellis i would like to ask staff to speak to what was in their original recommendation ive had stakeholders let me know that 15 per cent isnt workable i want to know how staff arrived at their original numbers   111224 pm   housing and planning department  we did not have the opportunity to do specific analysis for the proposed percentages but based at a slightly higher percentage understanding that would likely be feasible with increased heights and then also had an option for lower mfis at a different percentage that we think will be approximately the same cost to developers   ellis what numbers were in your original proposal   it was 12 so in a vmu2 building with a height bonus it would be 12 per cent at 60 per cent mfi or 10   111326 pm  per cent at 50 per cent mfi   ellis i would like to make a motion at the appropriate time to go with those numbers instead   mayor adler council member ellis moves to amend  sorry   ellis 138   kitchen i have    mayor adler hang on a second ann 138 to take 15 to what   ellis 12   mayor adler 12 and to take 12 on line 145 to 10 second to that amendment   ellis if i get a second im happy to speak to it   mayor adler ill second it you can speak to     ellis thank you the feedback i got is when we miscalibrate these numbers we end up not getting the projects   111426 pm  built at all after the hours weve put in the discussions i want to make sure they pencil out and were not going through all this work and discussion to have projects that will not be built and will not result in additional housing   kitchen mayor i have a question for ms leek   mayor adler go ahead   kitchen i was understanding from our previous conversations that staff was more comfortable now with the 15 per cent and 12 per cent because of the additional entitlements that we are putting in place particularly now that the rest of the council  or the council voted to do that by right so weve got someone  developer by right will now be  have access to 90 feet at reduced compatibility particularly reduced compatibility around the orange and blue lines so   111526 pm  thats quite of a bit of additional entitlement it would seem to me  the original recommendation you made was based on the 90 feet not these other additional entitlements so i had thought from our previous conversation that you were more comfortable now given all these other pieces we also have parking reduction now also i thought that you were more comfortable with the 15 and 12 per cent so are you comfortable with the 15 and 12 per cent   i believe our discussiondepended on what the changes were to compatibility   kitchen right   so as hopefully you all saw in our analysis that was completed last week on vmu sites depending on the extent of  or the distance that compatibility standards apply   111627 pm  it means that different sizes of sites would be more likely to participate in the program and at the 300foot distance that i think you all adopted today for  well anyway  so the only places where the hundredfoot compatibility applies is along the orange and blue lines and so they  those may be locations where development is more feasible at higher affordability levels but in places where  compatibility standards still have a large impact on small sites i think were going to see much less participation in the program especially at higher affordability levels   kitchen right and i really appreciated the analysis yall did and im looking for it now the compatibility requirements   111730 pm  that we just passed would allow getting to  would allow getting to 90 feet either right at a hundred feet or on the orange and blue line at 200 feet on the large corridors and at 250 on the smaller corridors in addition the original v would be expanded also with the compatibility requirements that we just changed which would allow that 65 feet  im going to have to look it up im not remembering that part but im looking for your analysis which showed us  i think it showed us doubling or so maybe im looking at  maybe you can explain that anyway well we may not need that im not  anyway   in general    kitchen its up to you all im not trying to change your   111832 pm  recommendation thats within your own professional judgment i just thought that from the conversations that we had before  i thought we were moving forward  i thought you had let us know that you were okay with the 15 and 12 per cent im hearing you say now that youre not is that right   i said it depended on what the compatibility standards changes were going to end up being because that part wasnt yet decided   kitchen yeah and i thought that meant  maybe i misunderstood but i thought what you meant was if we adopted what was proposed in 66 which we have now done and weve gone beyond that with council member velas change to the orange and blue lines i respect your professional judgment tell us what youre thinking if youre not comfortable with 15 and 12 per cent i hear that i personally think were not pushing the envelope enough   111935 pm  affordable housing is our number one priority particularly along these transit corridors so im not certain why we wouldnt do that    without modelling which we have not had an opportunity to do its hard to say whether it will be too much of a requirement so that people dont participate in the program in places that are not along the orange and blue lines there are many of our corridors where the sites are not necessarily very deep and so the changes to compatibility standards that are not along the blue and orange lines may not have much of an impact on what can be built   mayor adler mayor pro tem   alter thank you i just wanted to clarify though that what i was hearing though was that along the blue and orange line those   112037 pm  might be appropriate   we havent modeled it but it seems likely that since the compatibility standards are less impactful along those lines because of the limited distance that there would be greater feasibility for higher percentages of affordable units   alter okay how difficult is the modelling process   we would need to collect different data that we havent had the opportunity to collect yet so an option we have talked about internally is wanting to have a more streamlined and regular way to update percentage setasides and fee in lieu calibrations so one option would be to set something now and then in another year we could come back and look at it again   alter so let me just throw   112139 pm  out we are differentiating compatibility based on the orange and blue line we could differentiate the levels of affordability according to the blue and orange line or we could use the corridors that we set up i dont know whether we can do that on the fly tonight at 1115 or not i do believe its getting late and this is an important conversation and there are a lot of pieces here i think we also have you know  we havent landed on the process for getting vmu2 or the the second tier of vmu however we want to do that we may want to consider having a joint meeting with the planning commission and the council that has better notice for people since some things have changed since we just noticed   112240 pm   i just throw that out there in case anyone is thinking along the same line i favor affordability but understand there is a difference for different roads given the compatibility changes and given the possibility for having the transit also makes it more likely that those projects may be more feasible in terms of capacity so i just throw that out there for other people to think about i dont think we do our best work when were working this late   mayor adler i think thats true too i know its hard if were going to miss this id rather miss this in a way that has a lot of housing thats developed and built than to miss it in a way that doesnt have a lot of housing built if we put it out there and everybody starts using it and its apparent we undershot we can fix it and what a wonderful problem that would be to come back and fix it   112340 pm  so for me im going to support council member ellis deal if we want to get a finer comb on it and set different percentages for different roads for different stuff id be fine considering that too if someone wanted to come back with that but when we set percentages without calibration to me its just hard which is why i urge staff to have somebody on staff who can do calibration because it would be great if we just said 20 per cent and sa per cent thats better than 15 and 12 but we dont know whether that would work either erika was asked six ways to wednesday to try to speak in favor of it i think she was uncomfortable doing that anyhow thats where i come down council member renteria and then council member tovo   renteria i just want to say that its not going to   112440 pm  affect the blue line as much either way that you have it here the blue line area especially in my district is pretty much built out theres a few efrply lots that can be  efrpempty lots that can be built by using this if you drive up and down what we already have passed its getting built out pretty quick and so i dont know how much its really going to do to my blue line in my district because of what has been already been built out in that area   mayor adler council member tovo   i support the higher level of affordability the percentages that you brought forward council member kitchen and i believe that mark rogers wrote to all of us  mark   112543 pm   rogers director of gaudalupe neighborhood corporation sent an email to all of us back on may 19th and i just want to quote a few things that he said he talked about simply getting  im going to excerpt here  missing some of the other points but im going to hit on the ones that relate to this simply getting more housing will not get us affordable the fact that that austin in texas in is painfully obvious weve gotten less and less affordable he goes on to talk about compatibility and welcomes changing those but he asks us to ask some questions why do we typically require 10 per cent affordability when we increase entitlements where does that come from now im summarizing what are our goals needs priorities why are other desirable and fast growing cities able to get   112645 pm  25 per cent affordability with their programs or when development intietmentes are increased some of you probably answered that last question they have inclusionary zoning and thats illegal in texas he goes on to talk about how you know  ill skip to the end  people want to come to austin and developers want to develop for them they can incorporate higher levels of affordability in their developments if they know they have to wherever theres inclusionary development they do whats required they know thats what they have to do i think we have to set high goals this is the strategy that we have we need to use the tools that we have in our tool box and within a density bonus program we can ask for those higher levels of affordability and i think we should   mayor adler okay anyone else want to speak on this before we vote   kitchen couple of other   112747 pm  facts id like to point out to folks is that  and thank you again to staff for putting this together but we are doubling the estimate of the number of  with the changes in compatibility that we just voted for in number 66 we are doubling our ability to reach achievable vmu heights at the base under vmu i and at the 90 foot so were doing that were also  i want to point out too  the 10 per cent at 50 per cent mfi which has been proposed before we consider these compatibility changes  the current vmu program is 10 per cent at 60 per cent mfi so all were doing is going from  were giving 30 more   112850 pm  feet were changing compatibility and were saying that were still going to keep it at 10 per cent and you just have to drop from 60 per cent mfi to 50 per cent mfi i want to point that out the other thing i want to point out is that by the time we recalibrate this at the rate our city is growing  i can tell you this about south lamar at the rate our city is growing were losing opportunities that we will not have  again because once those are built up theyre built and we will not be able to go back and get more affordable housing so im in the afraid of builders not being able to do this im afraid that were losing a significant affordable housing along our major transit corridors   mayor adler okay lets take a vote council member vela   vela just a quick comment im comfortable raising the   112951 pm  affordable requirements along the orange and blue lines i am  this is just based from discussions i have had with regard  with different folks in the real estate industry and with you know habitat for humanity and other organizations but im uncomfortable with a broader  i just dont know what effect it would have and i would echo both the mayor and council member ellis comments where if we overshoot on that we get potentially zero whereas if we undershoot we still get the housing and we still get the lower levels of affordability  10 per cent 12 per cent i want to say im very torn on the affordability requirement   mayor adler you want to make the amendment to the amendment to take the higher numbers on the blue and orange lines   vela i will make the amendment to say the 15 and 12   113052 pm  per cent affordability requirements would be just for the orange and blue lines   mayor adler is there a second to that amendment council member kitchen seconds that any discussion council member ellis is that okay with you   ellis i can accept that thank you   mayor adler any objection to that amendment that amendment to the amendment made anyone object to that being incorporated into the motion hearing none that is incorporated into the motion   kitchen i need to vote against the motion so id like to have them separate i support what council member vela said and i want to vote for that but im going to vote against lowering for everything else if you could separate those two that would be helpful   mayor adler okay those in favor of having 15 and 12 per centages for tracts that are on the orange and blue   113152 pm   line please raise your hand unanimous on the dais those in favor of reducing the number from 15 and 12 to 12 and 10 otherwise not on the blue and orange line please raise your hand   harpermadison my hand is raised and i have a question id like answered before i vote   mayor adler go ahead   harpermadison the question i have is probably for staff but because im virtual i cant see who all is in the room i keep hearing words like overshoot and im making some assumptions about what the implications are but id like for someone with professional background in building vertical mixed use to give me their thoughts on what are the implications of over andor undershooting it seems to me that overshooting means well find ourselves in one of those situations where the numbers dont pencil out and then we   113253 pm  get nothing but id like to hear i can see a hand but not a face theres somebody at the podium right   erika leek housing and planning by overshoot do you mean having the affordable housing percentages be too high so that people are unlikely to participate okay can you restate your question then   harpermadison ultimately the question was is it difficult for staff to support the item because if we overshoot we dont get  the project isnt possible im trying to find a more eloquent way to express what i would otherwise use swear words to describe what im asking is if the project doesnt shake out and   113354 pm  you get absolutely nothing what is the  i guess what are the chances whats the  statistically speaking what are the chances that we set the level too high and then dont get the housing that were ultimately attempting to yield   i mean i dont think i have any statistics that i would feel comfortable sharing just because i dont think we have statistics in the way i think youre asking for them in general weve been trying to look at how much  how many people have participated in our programs and what  basically what seems to be working well along with calibration when we are able to do that obviously there are changes being made to the ordinance and   113457 pm   compatibility standards that mean there are a lot of different factors at play and so were trying to figure out you know is there a way that we can look at these changes in small ways over a period of time to make sure that were not moving  were not changing so quickly that the program isnt used but sam do you want to say it in a different way   i think  hi council the only statistic thats coming to mind is what we talked about in i believe the housing and planning committee meeting about our current participation rate for this program whereby nature of it being an incentivebased volunteer often kind of program developers can choose to redevelop their programs through base entitlements or   113559 pm  through another program like affordability unlocked by nature of it being incentivebased approach our  i think i was inaccurate before but its 36 per cent that have vmu zoning that have redeveloped that have participated in the program so i think what is at risk when we change the requirements to participate is potentially driving that participation rate lower so you just see fewer projects that redevelop opting into the vertical mixeduse program that might participate or might redevelop their property under their base entitlement for many of your vmu sites have dash u we might see more properties develop under a different entitlement than their  than the dash v would give them   113659 pm  which gives us affordable i hope it made it clear and not less clear   harpermadison that was really helpful but inspires another question which makes me wonder whether or not weve done the necessary amount of financial analysis   so some of the analysis that we did to get to the rates were included in the staff recommendation were looking back at previously calibrated work and so that was looking at comparable zones from our land development code and the calibrated affordability set aside rates that were recommended at that time that had gone through extensive financial modelling there are plenty of differences between the two but that is what drove  we took the highest set aside rate that was potentially feasible and that was 12 per cent and acknowledging the communitys desire to see lower mfis or   113801 pm   deeper affordability we tried to find a  the comparable cost to a developer to provide more housing at 50 per cent mfi so that looked like 10 per cent set aside at 50 per cent of the median family income was equivalent to 12 per cent set aside at 15 per cent of the median family income its not apples to apples and not particularly recent but that is what staff used to create our recommendation   harpermadison thats very helpful thank you   mayor adler okay  yes council member ellis   ellis i just wanted to quickly make sure the motion was for 12 per cent and so per cent as originally specified in staffs original recommendation   mayor adler that is the motion it was seconded those in favor of the ellis   113901 pm  amendment raise your hand   vela i have to wait for a second could i get you to summarize the ellis amendment right quick   mayor adler its on nonblue nonorange to keep staff recommendation of 12 per cent   vela okay   mayor adler those in favor raise your hand renteria vela harpermadison ellis and me those opposed raise your hand its the other six the amendment does not pass so it stays at 15 and 12 i think we skipped over a change it was the deletion of the fee in lieu is staff here to speak to that the question is whether or not theres a payment of fee in lieu for owneroccupied housing development why did you include that and   114003 pm  what do you think about taking it out   the reason were recommending fee in lieu only for ownership units is that the city is not able to control fees such as homeownership hoa fees condo fees and specifically special assessments as part of condo developments and therefore we have been unable to really keep people being able to afford to live in mixedincome condo units so we very much want to create affordable homeownership options and really think that we have more success creating those through land trusts and other totally affordable   114103 pm   ownership units where we have much more control over special assessments condo association fees et cetera so that is the reason that we proposed having the fee in lieu only for ownership and thus far the percentage of developments using vmu that are ownership has been very low i believe its under five per cent so it doesnt seem like its a program thats being used very often for ownership but we want to make sure that if people do participate we can use those funds which would be set at a rate that could actually help us make it possible for us to be able to build affordable ownership units elsewhere that would stay affordable over the long term   mayor adler thank you that language was on line 73 to   114204 pm  79 of the original staff proposal its not in council member kitchens because it was language that was deleted   kitchen ill let my cosponsors speak to this also the thinking is that we are  you know from a policy perspective what were wanting to see is affordable units along transit corridors and thats the goal here so if were going to fee in lieu were not accomplishing that goal so thats the reason for deleting that and i invite my cosponsors if they want to  or anybody else for that matter if anybody else wants to speak to that   mayor adler lets see if its an issue first anybody else want to second it anyone want to move to reinstate it hearing none well move on to   114306 pm  the next item   kitchen the last was on page 7 this one  may need to hear from staff also but this has to do with the bedroom count we changed the language somewhat from what staff and ill let them explain what their thinking was but the wording that we have is at the discretion of the director the mix of bedroom count may be adjusted but the overall number of required affordable units may not be reduced so the concept here is  the first sentence is that you know generally speaking the bedroom count is going to be  first off it says the bedroom count for affordable units shall be comparable to the bedroom count for market rate units whats the mix of bedroom count so this is just suggesting that   114408 pm   at the discretion of the director that mix of bedroom count could be adjusted but you would  you would not want to reduce the number of affordable units thats what i was thinking and if staff would like to speak to what their suggestion was   what were finding in most of the vmu developments is that the affordable units are  that are being provided are just efficiencies and one bedrooms and we have certainly heard councils desire to have more multibedroom affordable units and so we were trying to provide the flexibility so that a developer could potentially provide an affordable unit with four bedrooms but it would be in exchange for fewer overall units and so if this new   114513 pm  language is added then we think that we wouldnt get those larger  we wouldnt get the larger units thats what we think the result would be   kitchen let me ask you a question i was thinking that theres  that  i was thinking that theyre required already to do a comparable mix so in other words if they have  if theyre building market rate and they have two to one mix  if they have two bedrooms already some of their affordable units  how does that work it has to be comparable right is that right   yes and im trying to figure out where it is in here yes the idea is that it would have the same mix of type of units but if you wanted larger  units with more bedrooms than is normal in the complex than that  then   114613 pm  thats where you would have an exchange   kitchen okay so weve already got a baseline that if a complex is going to  if a complex has a mix of you know two or three bedrooms and one bedrooms that that same mix has to be available for the affordable units so we have that already so what youre thinking is if you wanted more than the mix in market rate for larger units  is that the thinking   yes that is the concept   kitchen okay i understand that you know i understand that but i feel like  we just felt like it was better to make sure we werent giving in on reducing the number of units so i leave that to my colleagues to decide what they want to do with that   mayor adler council member kelly   114713 pm    kelly id like to make a motion to postpone this item to june 16th   kitchen i cannot  were almost through   mayor adler hang on a second lets see if theres a second to the motion to postpone is there a second to the motion mayor pro tem seconds it discussion of the motion to postpone   kelly i do appreciate this discussion but its 1147 i can see it going a lot longer based on what were talking about thats all i have to say about that   kitchen can i speak to it mayor   mayor adler yes you may   kitchen weve done a lot of work here i appreciate the time this is the last item out of this i think were very close to being done weve already handled what i understand to be the most toughest issues so i really really would like to get this done so if you would bear with us maybe another 20 minutes or so 15 minutes  i think were   114814 pm  almost there   mayor adler ready to take a vote those in favor of postponement raise your hand mayor pro tem and council member kelly those opposed please raise your hand balance of the dais with council member harpermadison off   i couldnt make a decision so i didnt vote im also exhausted and there are issues im struggling with   mayor adler lets keep going so the question in front of us the  i would once again rely on the expertise of our staff with respect to the bedroom mix their explanation made sense to me if someone else wants to make a motion to stay with the staff i would second   vela just to be clear on the staffs explanation so in other words the requirement would not be of the units per se but it would be of the   114916 pm  bedroom count within the bidding is that more or less  you know in other words lets say it has a hundred units but three bedroom so 10 per cent would be 30 bedrooms whether its 10 three bedrooms or    kitchen no    mayor adler hang on a second let staff respond to this   kitchen okay   yeah so the similarities between staff recommendation and council member kitchens is that the mix of the bedroom unit ins the entire development what youre speaking to needs to match the mix by basically all the affordable units if you have 20 per cent of the units are one bedroom 20 per cent  thats the same in both the difference is theres a line in the staff recommendation that says at the discretion of the director two  sorry two bedroom unit or three bedroom unit may be counted as two or three onebedroom units   115017 pm  we would like to exchange two studio units for one two bedroom apartment in our affordable unit so we can get more in these developable units that would be a net loss of one total unit same number of bedrooms if you think about it that way it would be beyond the mix of the overall market rate development thats the difference from the council recommendation   vela the goal would be encouraging basically familyroommate situations for affordability purposes i would make the motion to adopt the staff recommendation   mayor adler okay is there a second to that   ill second   mayor adler okay council member ellis seconds do you want to address it first   vela i think staff spoke to it particularly well honestly i would  i know it is late and im losing track a little bit but why would we   115118 pm  not want to encourage the larger bedroom  you know what i mean  the larger multifamilytype    kitchen could  shall i speak to that mayor   mayor adler hang on a second   i want to make sure it doesnt go the other way that in this discretionary language staff would end up saying not as many two and three bedroom units were going to make them all the single or studio because im looking for ways to amplify and support the larger number of bedrooms in the units   i understand and the way staff recommendation was written would only apply the one way and it was created to we would try to get more multibedroom and less of the studio    i think that sounds pretty good   mayor adler further   115219 pm  discussion on vela amendment council member tovo   i need you to repeat your amendment please   vela adopt the staff recommendation with regard to the bedroom flexibility unit mix  flexibility whereby you know for example four single  they could do two   i get the intent im just asking for the language whats the language   vela original language from the staff recommendation   i have it somewhere but if you could remind me   it is on page six line 202 through 204 i think and its at the discretion of the director  two bedroom or three bedroom affordable units may count as efficiency affordable units   mayor adler there are three sentences the first and third remain the   115319 pm  same the only thing being changed is the second which has been highlighted by council member kitchen you can see the highlighted language reading again the language that the staff had at the discretion of the director two bedroom or three bedroom affordable units may count as two or three one bedroom efficiency affordable units   kitchen mayor    mayor adler council member kitchen   kitchen it seems to me that the will of the dais is to stay with staffs version im happy to do that   mayor adler anybody object to the vela amendment hearing none the vela amendment  we go back to staff language in that area   kitchen okay mayor thats all the changes   mayor adler okay   kitchen what i have here    mayor adler one of our colleagues has asked to reconsider her vote council member kelly    115419 pm   kelly i would like to consider the vote on the ellis amendment it was late and i was not following as i should have been closely to how we were voting on that   mayor adler ellis had two amendments one was changing 12 tell me which result you want to change right now we are 12 per cent and 15 per cent for both blue and orange lines and also for the other lines   kelly correct it would be the one on the nonblue orange lines   mayor adler council member kelly makes a motion to reconsider second to that council member vela seconds that any discussion on the motion to reconsider   kitchen i couldnt quite hear which vote we were reconsidering   mayor adler the one that had us going from 10 to 12 per   115521 pm  cent to 12 to 15 per cent on the nonorange and blue lines the orange and blue lines weve gone from 12 to 15 per cent do we take the staff recommendation of 10 to 12 on the other lines or do we also go to 12 to 15 on the nonorange and blue lines   i have one procedural thing council member vela was not on the prevailing side   mayor adler he can second it he cant make the motion motion has to be made by someone on the prevailing side and council member kelly was any further discussion those in favor of allowing the reconsidering please raise your hand vela kelly  this is the nonorange and blue line   115623 pm  renteria me harpermadison and ellis those opposed balance of the dais motion to reconsider passes   kitchen mayor   mayor adler yes   kitchen just a point of order  not a point of order sorry on a motion to reconsider can the entire dais vote on it or     mayor adler entire dais can vote all right we havent decided this question that just gets us back to ground zero okay theres an amendment in front of us to change the base motion from council member kitchen  going  has us having 12 and 15 per cent for the other than blue and orange lines the motion the amendment is to go back to the staffs recommendation of 10 and 12 for the nonblue and orange lines its been  is there  were   115723 pm  reconsidering that vote its in front of us no all right lets take a vote those in favor of the amendment please raise your hand   indiscernible   mayor adler 10 to 12 for the nonblue and orange lines all right its vela kelly renteria ellis harpermadison and me those opposed please raise your hand and it is the balance of the dais 65 that amendment passes okay are there any other amendments to this item 80 councilmember kitchen council  hang on one second did you have something for us   i just need a housekeeping   115823 pm  amendment in the event that this passes we have references to orange and blue lines in the draft ordnansz however we will need to put the street names in there so wed like to have the authority to add that to the ordinance when we have those names   mayor adler making that change hearing none yes you have that authority councilmember kitchen   kitchen this is in backup  well its actually  its direction mayor so do you want me to do that now or do you want to finish    mayor adler does anybody have any other amendments to number 80   kitchen i think councilmember tovo does   tovo yes i distributed this earlier and its similar to the one that you all proposed and passed on 66 and it is accepted as more narrow this prohibits an affordable unit from being used as a type two or type three shortterm rental   mayor adler okay anybody   115925 pm   have any objection to this amendment any objections to this amendment seeing none this amendment is incorporated into the base motion any other amendments councilmember kitchen did you have a direction that you wanted to propose   kitchen you want me to do that now   mayor adler please   kitchen the direction they passed out and this is to be responsive to questions that were raised by some in our community that are very concerned about the impact of  and the potential for displacement and so its  the city manager is directed to analyze and to report to council the feasibility of the following approach and the approach just speaks to  it just speaks to analyzing what was requested of us by the public which was a recognition that  that in some   120025 am  areas of town 60 of mfi may be higher than the folks that are living in that area so the direction is for  is for staff to analyze the feasibility of some options and one of those options might be that you could say 60 of the mfi or 80 of the mfi in the census block group this direction is not intended to state a specific approach its just asking in response to what the public has been asking us to  for staff to give some consideration and let us know if theres something that you would recommend to take account for that   mayor adler does anybody have any objection to this amendment i think that its good that you bring this up because we do hear this a lot from the public i think that this kind of thing   120127 am  unfortunately would be a fair housing violation but we should find out and youre asking for that to be considered and for feasibility to be looked at and i support that so without objection this direction is also incorporated are we ready to take a vote on number 80 take a vote those in favor of number 80 as amended with the direction please raise your hand those opposed councilmember tovo votes no those voting aye it passes theres one thing left its the zoning case i dont know how involved that is jerry is that    we could probably do it in about five to 10 minutes tops am moip okay lets do it   and i would ask real quick mayor we have a couple hears that are on changes of corrections   120229 am   and can i get an agreement and to staff postpone to july 28th and number 6 july 28th and indiscernible to june 16th   mayor adler okay is there a motion to approve those postponements any discussion those in favor please raise your hands those opposed unanimous on the dais take us to the zoning case   the last one is item number 120 and its case c1420220003 and as for the 212regiene lane and to have and to have commercialmixed   120331 am  usevertical mixed use building neighborhood and the planning commission voted in favor and the proposed project is a multifamily project and today there are 16 existing apartments on the site and the applicant is proposing a project to result in 52 bedroom units and 265 onebedroom units and i believe that the applicant has comments to make regarding tenant relocation on this site and the applicant has at there time filed a demolition permit with the city and the tenant process has not commenced so solely at the zoning stage at this point and im available for any questions   mayor adler all right it looks like the applicant is speaking up and has five minutes   good evening mayor mayor pro tem   mayor adler thank you for your patience   im alice glasgow im with the entity that has the property under contract if i could have   120432 am  representation please this shows the subject site highlighted in blue and gmruzmp and its surrounded by rezoning and in proximity to cameron road which is a transit corridor and an imagine austin corridor next slide this is an aerial view of the site it has 16 units however only 14 are currently occupied next slide just a picture of one of the buildings and the age of the buildings are between 35 years old to 81 years old next so this just gives you comparison of the zoning you had a lot of discussion tonight about mu zoning and v zoning and the differences and this site is currently zoned jumrucomp and under the zoning the allowed number of units is   120533 am   106 and those would be  none of them are required to be affordable theyd all be market rate units however by adding the v vmu combining district we are contemplating 249 units and out of those 10 would be affordable and thats 25 units at the mfi level that you just adopted so thats what the vmu does next slide so weve had three meetings with the tenants and my client just has the property under contract and they do not own the property so the tenant relocation assistance that we have offered would apply after they become the owners of the property ill start off with number one one month free rent at any gr property with a signing of a 12month lease as well as the jci and the properties that weve shared with our tenants   120634 am  they would waive application and administration fees obviously theyre subject to tenant qualifications because those properties are regulated by the tax credit projects and they have to adhere to prequalification to be a tenant second all residents receive their final twomonths free on current leases and a rebate for relocation assistance only applicable after the purchase of the property and then number three all residents have the first right of return to the new future development at 1124 clayton lane and number four all residents have the first right to reserve a unit at the new development windsor park two towers apartments project would open in 2023 and at 6007 not too far from the subject site at  that is on your agenda tonight   120735 am  number four all current leases at the old homestead will not expire they will remain in effect until they can stay there until january 31 2023 and includes monthtomonth leases also and all current leases will have the option to extend their current lease terms if they are about to expire to 231 223 and all are not subject to an early termination fee if the resident wants to stop their lease before the current term they can do so and no leases cut short of their lease term unless requested by the resident per the above all lease holders that are current on rent through the end of their lease term their deposits would be returned in full so the current rents are between  the lowest is 900 per month and the highest rent   120835 am  is 1750 so the total package if you get one month free rent if you move to one of the grc residential properties and two months of your free rent and your full deposit returned thats equivalent to four months of rent so a total a range of 3600 to 7000 depending how much obviously your rent is and your deposit was your full amount of rent so this is what we offered up as an update to what weve  been discussing and this was last issued to the tenants this monday the 6th of june i will pause here and answer any questions that you might have if you want to note anything else  buzzer thank you   mayor adler thank you councilmember kitchen   kitchen just quickly ill just ask one quick question because i think were going to postpone this because  well   120935 am  i wont even ask it i can ask it later   mayor adler all right   do you know how many of the current tenants would qualify for affordable housing like the 80 at the other jci property   i dont know all i can tell you is that the tenants the rents are pretty comparable you know to the one and two bedrooms at least the two that are  two of the projects that are referencing are  in partnership with hawco and one in partnership with travis county housing authority  housing finance corporation similar to what you have with austin housing with the city of austin housing corporation so thats the comparable but we have given them the information and asked them to apply i think that only two tenants have expressed an interest and reached out to those units to   121037 am  get assistance in signing up for those units but we mention those because the rents  when you compared the  they pay 900 how to and for the same unit 1019 at the other apartments and those are the rents that are there for your twobedroom units for example at bridge at grenada which is district 4 councilmember vela the twobedroom units start at 1421 per month and old homestead from 1050 to 1500 and at the bring in turtle creek in district 2 that was just built using vmu and the partner is hawco and for the onebedroom units its 919 and two bedrooms 1421 the rent at the hold homestead for one bedroom is 900 in   121138 am  comparison the twobedroom would be 1050 to 1500 so we only have one being rezoned at 1750 a month    vela thank you   kitchen just  im sorry  just one quick question do we know that those  that theres availability at these other units   yes yes there is availability   kitchen have we guaranteed them   weve  weve  weve offered that  they reach out to the  to the  to the management company and apply because theres a screening requirement just like any other placement especially if their tax credit units they have to adhere to the qualification requirements to apply so weve provided information only two have reached out to   121238 am  apply and we assist in making sure that we reserve a unit for them if they reach out   kitchen this is a much longer conversation and we dont need to have it tonight but what im hearing from the residents is that there isnt  there arent places affordable to them at their current level but thats a longer conversation   well those  the rents that are just quoted to you and those projects are in association again with hawca and austin and travis county   mayor adler okay is there a motion on this councilmember kelly and then councilmember tovey   kelly yeah i guess that i dont need this answered now if we are going to postpone it but i have concerns about those that may go through the application process that maybe dont qualify and if there are plans for that but again you dont have to answer that now and perhaps when it comes back we can address that   mayor adler councilmember tovo   tovo a couple things   121342 am  ms glasco can you please provide us with that powerpoint and i know that we can go back to the transcript and go over it but if you could provide us with that powerpoint that would be useful and if you provided us with the rents and i didnt quite capture all of them it sounded to me like the rates for a onebedroom one bath at old homestead are a little under maybe five out of a hundred dollars a month of the efficiency at the other units so i think that to get a comparable im just trying to think this through but to get a comparable unit it sounds like theyd look at an increase    it would be high especially since the tdhc issued their new  their new mfi rates and they did go up slightly yes but theyll be at least some dollars higher 19  like the one bedroom  paying 900 at   121444 am  homestead and 919    tovo you would be going    correct  multiple voices   tovo so if you could provide us with that information that would be helpful to just to try to get a handle on that i also want to just appreciate a couple things about this process one is thank you for your continued work with the tenants and you continued listening and addressing their very valid and very real concerns about relocating and relocating to places that are nearby and always at the same  at the same level and i hope that dialogue continues i want to also to just appreciate those of you who are living in  who are living there the residents for your advocacy and for the advocacy not just for your own housing but also for that of your neighbors i hope that does dialogue  that dialogue will continue i would like to see  i would like  i hope that there might   121545 am  be an opportunity for some additional relocation assistance and so i hope that will continue as this gets postponed and the conversation continues   yeah and i will correct myself  i am reading my chart here correct that the other units the low amount is an efficiency unit and the onebedroom    tovo so  so    mayor adler councilmember kitchen   kitchen so so  okay so theres not a comparable  the smaller units they actually have to pay more to get the same size that theyre in right now   slightly more correct therefore like the brigitte grenada is closest to this site in district 4 so the one bedroom units would   121647 am   be 1188   kitchen so there is a difference and then the last question would be the application  i think councilmember kelly asked a similar question but have you explored the possibility of streamlining any kind of application process   the minimum requirements  because they are tax credit and the same  actually the same procedures the same requirements that you have to have so much  two months of rent in your income its a list of several requirements that  that are required by tdhca the texas department of housing and community affairs for tax creditfunded projects my understanding in talking to your department the citys housing department for the austin finance corporation projects like have similar funding you have the same criteria for   121748 am  screening tenants so its the same screening criteria that the city ahc housing projects are subject to the same screening requirements here so theyre required by tdhc and we cant waive the screening requirements and i think that is the    kitchen can you consider allowing additional time before they have to move out   we have the  there are current leases  the current owner was to end 31 december of this year 2022 and we agreed to  agreed to extend them to the end of january 31 2023 as opposed to december which is during the holidays so it would be after christmas or the end of january of 2023   kitchen well i would just ask that you continue to work very directly with them i may have specific questions   121849 am  for you after this   okay   kitchen its a very difficult market for people particularly who have lived at this place for a long time its very difficult for them to find another location so  and from what you have told us even at other properties its difficult to find anything thats comparable so i would encourage you to keep working with them and i think that i might have some specific  some additional specific questions for you before this comes back to us   okay sounds great   mayor adler okay is there a motion on this    vela i will make a motion to postpone briefly to speak to the motion i do want to give them additional time to hopefully to come to an agreement but i want to echo councilmember tovos comments that i have dealt with in the few months that i have been on the dais i have already dealt with multiple displacement cases and i respect the fact that in   121951 am  other cases that i have dealt with there was lying to the tenants about the intentions of the landlords and there was really kind of deception and really bad faith and this is not been the case i appreciate you know that giving them seven eight months of heads up that theres going to be something on the table i just  whenever  i think that landlords and developers do the right thing i mean we call them out and well beat them up if they do the wrong thing and when i think that someone is trying to act honorably and in good faith i also want to recognize that so i do appreciate the jci and your efforts to try to come to a fair accommodation with the tenants theyre struggling too its a charming little spot and its a great little spot and i know that the tenants are in sticker shock because a lot of them havent moved in a while and irthat looking around and going oh my lord and i wont   122051 am  potentially be able to stay in the same neighborhood but i will move to postpone this    mayor adler to when   vela to any  suggestions   we could try for next week the 16th   vela move to postpone to next week   mayor adler a second to the motion to postpone councilmember kelly seconds the motion any discussion those in favor please raise your hands those opposed unanimous on the dais and that item is postponed and thank you for staying so late   thank you   mayor adler and that is all of the agenda items but we have yet to give everyone a chance to the consent do we want to do that or ready to go home and to go to bed   lets just tweet our comments please   mayor adler there you have it then so at  i offered  1221 in the morning im sorry what go ahead    122152 am   thank you i want to thank you all for your support on my adu item i had a lot to say about that but ill skip it because i will explain why i abstained from item number 38 and if we have just a few moments ill daylight why and the item was to ratify the multiple emergency contracts with various contractors to provide services related to the coronavirus pandemic and in amount the 419 million my staff and i went through those different invoices and purchase orders and some of the billing did seem to be consistent with covid19related expenses and there were a couple items that werent one example was an apartment with the images and renovations for 53000 and there were also some things that seemed inconsistent with the billing practices against the contracts and purchase orders and i could not support voting in favor of that item until some of those things were sorted out so thank you   mayor adler all right with that im going to adjourn the city council meeting here at 1222  122253 am    ')"
